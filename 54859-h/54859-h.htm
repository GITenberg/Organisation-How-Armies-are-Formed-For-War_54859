<h2 id="hdr_1">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>The Author was led to compile this account of
Army Organization owing to his inability to discover
any book dealing systematically with that
subject. Military writers do, of course, make
frequent allusions to Organization, but a previous
acquaintance with the subject is generally assumed.
One looks in vain for an explicit account, either
of the principles underlying organization, or of the
development of its forms and methods.</p>

<p>It is true that the word Organization figures in
the title of more than one Military treatise, but
the subject is handled unsystematically and empirically,
so that the ordinary reader is unable
to realize the significance of the facts. In some
cases the term Organization is interpreted in so
wide a sense as to include not only Tactics, Staff
Duties, and Administration, but any matters of
moment to an army. Thus, in the volume of
essays recently published, an author of weight states
that “Organization for War means thorough and
sound preparation for war in all its branches,” and
goes on to say, “the raising of men, their physical
and moral improvement ... their education and
training ... are the fruits of a sound organization.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
In the present work, Organization is taken in a
more literal and limited sense. The book would
otherwise have tended to become a discussion
of every question affecting the efficiency of armies.
The intention of the Author is to give in broad
outline a general account of Organization for War,
and of the psychological principles underlying the
exercise of Command, which it is the main purpose
of Organization to facilitate.</p>

<p>At the same time the organization discussed
is not restricted to that of the British Army, but
is that of modern armies in general, as well as of
individual armies in particular, that of the British
Army being described in greater detail, in Part II.</p>

<p>In Part IV. will be found a sketch of the History
of Organization, which should interest any one who,
like the Author, is not content with knowing things
as they happen to be at present, unless he can
trace the steps by which they came to be so.</p>

<p>The subject is intentionally not treated with
minuteness of detail. To have made the book
a cyclopædia of detailed information about organization
would have obscured its purpose. It
is hoped that the work may prove useful to the
increasing numbers of those who have taken up
Military work throughout the Empire, and not
uninteresting to general readers, and students of
history.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_3">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p>The Organization which it is the purport of this
work to describe is that of Armies in War. The
vast subject of Organization in Peace opens out
too wide a field. It is necessarily different in
every country, being based on national idiosyncrasies,
complicated by political, economic, and
topographical conditions. These factors, however
dominating in peace, have less influence on organization
for war. The general features of War
Organization are identical in all modern armies, as
they represent the consensus of expert opinion,
based on the practice of great leaders, and on the
lessons learnt from success and failure in recent
wars.</p>

<p>There are, of course, many differences in detail,
due to the varying historical development of each
army. These really indicate the degree to which
the conservative sentiments retarding improvement
have been bent to the changes necessitated
by progress. The strength of tradition and inertia
in armies is enormous. No human institutions—not
the Law, not even the Church—so cherish
ceremonial and reverence tradition and custom, or
remain so long blind to changed conditions. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii">xviii</a></span>
military arrangements the very object of their
existence often seems obscured by a haze of unessential
conventions. Military methods, once
suitable, soon pass into mere forms, which it is
considered sacrilegious to modify, however useless
or even harmful they have become.</p>

<p>Among scores of examples of the extraordinary
conservatism of military organization we may
remember that England had no transport organized
in the army she landed in the Crimea. We
find in Germany Army Corps of two Divisions,
Divisions of two Brigades, and Brigades of two
Regiments, although two is the worst possible
number of parts in a unit, according to Clausewitz
and common sense. The twentieth century saw
Cuirassiers in France, Rifles in most armies, and
the “parade step” in Germany. The protean follies
of uniform are only now partially disappearing.</p>

<p>The historical portion of this work shows the
curious way in which a new form of organization,
designed for a definite end, often loses sight of
its purpose and reverts to a mere variety of the
old type, which then has to put out a new development
for the original end. This is the history
of the numerous attempts to provide for Light
Infantry duties at the front.</p>

<p>The above considerations account for a number
of odd survivals in modern armies, and explain
many differences in their organization. These,
however, are always tending to diminish under the
pressure of the hard facts of war, which have little
respect for national prejudices and traditions.</p>

<p>A study of the present British war organization,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix">xix</a></span>
described in some detail in Part II., will show
that it embodies a large number of the changes
suggested by recent wars, and demanded by the
trend of modern military thought. The British
Army is the latest to be reorganized, and the
opportunity has been taken, with no less courage
than wisdom, to adopt in every Branch all changes
tending to fit it better for the fighting of the
immediate future, as far as this can be forecast.
When the reorganization is completed it is not too
sanguine to believe that the British will be the
best organized army of the day.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE OBJECT OF ORGANIZATION</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 id="hdr_4"><span class="smcap">Command</span></h3>

<p>In the British Field Service Regulations of 1909,
Part ii., chap. ii., par. 1, it is stated that the main
object of War Organization is to provide the
Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in the Field with
the means of exerting the required influence over
the work and action of every individual. This, it
is pointed out, will ensure the “combination and
unity of effort directed towards a definite object,”
on which mainly depends the successful issue of
military operations. In other words, the primary
object of War Organization is to facilitate <dfn>Command</dfn>—that
is, to ensure that every man in the
force acts promptly in response to the will of the
Commander.</p>

<p>A secondary object of War Organization is to
facilitate <dfn>Administration</dfn>, or the supply of each
individual in the Force with all that he requires to
make it possible for him not only to live, but to
move and fight. If a Force be ill-organized the
process of supply will be slow, uncertain, and incomplete,
the spirit and health of the men cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
fail to suffer, and the efficiency of the Force as a
fighting body to be reduced.</p>

<p>Both these objects of Organization—<em>Command</em>
and <em>Administration</em>—are, however, really inseparable.
The channels through which they act are
identical, and the Authority which commands is
necessarily responsible for the Administration which
enables his Orders to be carried out. Solicitude
for the well-being of the soldier is one of the most
certain means for obtaining influence over him,
and may be called the main lever for exercising
Command. Some further consideration of the
psychological factors of Command, which are
essentially germane to the study of Organization,
will be found in Part V. of this work.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_5"><span class="smcap">Definition of Organization</span></h3>

<p>The word “Organization”—literally, providing a
body with organs—has been more elaborately defined,
by Herbert Spencer, as “the bringing of
independent bodies into independent relations with
each other, so as to form a single organic whole in
which they all work together.” He goes on to
explain this as follows: “In considering the
evolution of living forms we find simple, homogeneous,
and non-coherent elements developing into
a complex, heterogeneous, and coherent whole, an
organism controlled by unity of purpose, and comprising
a number of functional parts, which work
together in mutual dependence for the common
good.” This definition applies closely to the
organization of military bodies. The elements
are represented by the individual soldiers, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
functional parts by the units, while in the Army
we see the living organism.</p>

<p>Just as in nature no mere assemblage of cells, or
even of functional parts, can form a living organism,
so no collection of individuals, however efficient—or
of small units, however perfect—can in any
true sense be called an Army. It might have the
appearance of a real military force, but it would
only be suited to peace. The means by which it can
be made fit for war is <dfn>Organization</dfn>, without which
it would be little better than an armed mob—inert,
or at best irregular and spasmodic in its movements.
An ill-organized army is not capable of
co-ordinated or of sustained action, owing to the
difficulty of either directing its movements or supplying
its wants.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_6"><span class="smcap">The Chain of Command</span></h3>

<p>It is obvious that a Commander of a Military
Force cannot deal personally and directly with all
those under his command, but only with a limited
number of subordinate commanders. Each of the
latter in his turn conveys his will to his own subordinates,
and this gradually broadening system,
called the <dfn>Chain of Command</dfn>, is carried on, till
every individual of the Force receives his Orders.
These Orders are founded on the original directions
of the Commander-in-Chief, with modifications
and details added by each lower authority in the
chain, so as to suit the special circumstances of his
own Command.</p>

<p>This principle combines unity of control with
decentralization of command and devolution of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
responsibility. In no other way can ready and
effective co-operation of all fractions of the force to
a common end be ensured.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_7"><span class="smcap">Units or Formations of Troops</span></h3>

<p>The method, generally speaking, of War Organization
is to provide the links in the chain of Command
by a systematic arrangement, in suitable
groups, of the various troops composing the Army.
The smallest groups, or <dfn>Units</dfn>, are combined in
larger ones, and these again are built up into more
complex bodies, and so on, until the whole Army is
formed in a small number of large bodies, whose
Commanders receive direct orders from the
Supreme Commander.</p>

<p>For want of a general name for these bodies it is
usual to speak of them all as <dfn>Formations</dfn>. The
term <dfn>Units</dfn>, which is often used, properly applies
only to the elementary groups. The largest Formations
are conveniently styled the <dfn>Subordinate Commands</dfn>
of the Army.</p>

<p>Each category of Formations forms a step in the
pyramid of organization, in which the lowest layer
is formed by the Units, the top layer by the Subordinate
Commands, and the apex by the Supreme
Commander. The Commanders of each Formation,
from the largest to the smallest, form the successive
links in the chain of Command.</p>

<p>All Formations should have such a strength and
composition as to be in the best relation and proportion
to each other, and to the larger groups
which they help to build up. Every Formation
should be formed of at least three subordinate Units.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
This gives the Commander of the whole due
importance over his Subordinate Commanders, and
ensures his retaining an adequate Command whenever
he wishes to detach one of his Units. This
would not be the case were there only two Units
in the whole, for, if one were detached, the Commander
of the whole would be left exercising Command
only over the other Unit, already adequately
commanded. The Superior Commander would
then be superfluous, and harmfully interfering with
his subordinate. A Formation with three or more
Units can be readily broken up when desired, without
affecting the principles of Command, and is
therefore more flexible and efficient than one with
only two Units. Emphasis is laid on this point by
Clausewitz in his classic work “On War.”</p>

<p>It is the purpose of the next few chapters
to describe the Units and Formations constituted
in modern armies. But, in order to explain the
reasons which have dictated their strength and
composition, it is necessary first to describe the
various kinds of Troops which go to make up
an Army, and their respective methods of fighting,
and functions in war. Organization exists to
facilitate fighting, and cannot be explained without
some discussion of Tactics.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="subhead">THE FIGHTING TROOPS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Military Forces are of two distinct categories:
<dfn>Fighting Troops</dfn>, which carry out the actual
operations; <dfn>Administrative Services</dfn>, whose function
is to provide the Fighting Troops with
all that they require to keep up their strength and
efficiency.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_8"><span class="smcap">The Arms of the Service</span></h3>

<p>The Fighting Troops consist mainly, as they
have for centuries, of what are known as “The
Three Arms of the Service”—Cavalry, Artillery,
and Infantry. Besides these, however, the introduction
of warlike inventions and the increased
complexity of modern war have brought into being
a fourth Arm—Engineers—as well as varieties of
fighting troops for special purposes, which are
virtually new Arms, such as Mountain Artillery,
Machine Guns, Cyclists, and Mounted Infantry.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_9"><span class="smcap">Characteristics of the Arms</span></h3>

<p>The continued existence of the Arms of the
Service for centuries is due to a gradual differentiation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
of their mode of fighting, owing to changes in
weapons, and progress in the Art of War. Each
Arm has its peculiar fighting characteristics and
its own sphere of action in war, which will be
discussed in this chapter. In the next will be
described the organization which each Arm has
evolved in order to enable it to carry out its
functions in war.</p>

<h4 id="hdr_10">1. CAVALRY</h4>

<h5>ITS SPECIAL FUNCTIONS</h5>

<p>Cavalry has been termed “The Arm of Surprise,”
owing to the rapidity with which it can
move. This gives it the power to act with little
warning, and from an unexpected direction, against
the enemy, and thus to take advantage of the
fleeting opportunities which occur in war for
sudden attack and surprise. It is <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">par excellence</i>
the mobile Arm, and the one best adapted for
taking the offensive.</p>

<p>Its power of making long and rapid marches
enables it also to be thrown far to the front, so as
to give to the Army protection from surprise, and
to gain the information as to the movements and
dispositions of the enemy, without which the
Commander will be at a loss in forming his plans.</p>

<p>Cavalry is required too for the effective pursuit
of a beaten foe who would elude the slow-moving
Infantry. It is also the best Arm to cover a
retreat, as it can check the pursuit and then effect
a rapid withdrawal before being completely over-powered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<h5>ITS WEAK POINTS</h5>

<p>The disadvantage of Cavalry is that it is very
dependent on the nature of the country for its
action. It is useless in steep, rocky, or marshy
ground, or among enclosures, and in woods.
Cavalry is also costly to raise, and requires long
training for efficiency. It suffers too from great
wastage of horses in war, due to unavoidable
fatigue, short rations, and bad weather, from
which causes horses suffer even more than men.</p>

<h5>ITS MODE OF FIGHTING</h5>

<p>In the combat, Cavalry acts both by shock and
by fire, the latter action being now more developed
than of old. Indeed the main difference between
the horse-soldiers of the different armies of to-day is
whether their training is directed rather to mounted
shock-action, or to fire-action dismounted; in the
latter case, their rapidity of movement is mainly
helpful in getting them to the right place at the
right time to use their fire. The ideal Cavalry
would be equally capable of shock and fire action,
and could be employed either mounted or dismounted,
as circumstances and the judgment of
the leader might dictate. The British is perhaps
the only Cavalry (as General Négrier, Chief of
the French General Staff, once said) which is
trained to this ideal. The Cavalry of Russia,
Japan, and the United States tends rather to
action by fire on foot; that of most Continental
armies to shock action mounted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>

<h5>EMPLOYMENT OF CAVALRY IN WAR</h5>

<p>The use of Cavalry in modern war lies less in its
action on the battlefield than in the all-important
work of reconnoitring the enemy, and protecting
its own army—that is, of providing <em>Information</em> and
<em>Security</em>. The tendency of the employment of
Cavalry in modern war is towards an entire separation
of these two duties.</p>

<p>For the first duty, <dfn>Reconnaissance</dfn>, Cavalry
must try to find out the strength and situation of
the enemy’s forces, and the direction in which they
are moving. For the second duty, <dfn>Protection</dfn>,
Cavalry must form a screen along the front of the
Army, so as to shelter it from being observed by
the enemy’s Cavalry, and to give early notice of
the direction of any attack.</p>

<p>These two duties of Cavalry cannot be performed
by the same body. To get <em>information</em>
Cavalry must be able to break through the
enemy’s screen, which can only be effected by
beating his Cavalry, and requires concentration of
force. Reconnoitring Cavalry will often also have
to work round the flanks of the enemy. Both
these modes of action must necessarily leave a
large portion of the front of its own army uncovered.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <em>protection</em> demands a dispersion
of the Cavalry along the whole front of the
Army, which is exactly opposed to the concentration
generally required for effective reconnaissance.</p>

<p>Again, reconnoitring Cavalry is only concerned
with keeping in touch with the enemy, while protective<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
Cavalry must remain in touch with its own
army.</p>

<p>The distinction between these functions of
Reconnaissance and Protection has become recognized
of late years, owing to the increased importance
of the Strategical direction of the large
masses of troops now in the field, which are not
easily diverted when once set in motion, and are
more than ever dependent on their Lines of Communication.
Their Commander needs constant
and recent information about the enemy, by which
to direct his movements and secure his flanks from
attack. Hence has arisen the practice of providing
two distinct bodies of Cavalry—the <dfn>Independent
Cavalry</dfn>, for reconnaissance by independent action
at a distance in front of the Army; and the <dfn>Protective
Cavalry</dfn>, spread over a wide area along the
front of the Army so as to form a screen.</p>

<p>In both cases the Cavalry effect the object by
sending out squadrons, which furnish patrolling
parties. The duty of these is not only to discover
the enemy’s movements, but to make such arrangements
for transmitting the information gained that
it shall reach Head-Quarters with rapidity and
certainty.</p>

<h4 id="hdr_11">2. ARTILLERY</h4>

<p>Artillery is the most powerful and far-reaching
of the Arms in its <em>fire</em> effect, but cannot act by
<em>shock</em>. It is the only Arm that can strike the
others at such a distance that they cannot retaliate,
and can injure material objects. Its <em>morale</em>
is less liable than that of the other Arms to fail<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
in battle, as Artillery is more dependent on the
mechanical than the human element for its action.
The guns, too—to which the personnel is attached
by sentiment and duty—give a definite point to
hold to when other troops are falling back. It is
on all these grounds a valuable auxiliary to the
other Arms.</p>

<h5>DISADVANTAGES OF ARTILLERY</h5>

<p>Artillery, however, is incapable of independent
action—it must always be associated with the
other Arms, as it is easily avoided or turned, and,
when moving, is helpless against attack. It takes
up a great deal of space in the column of march,
as well as on the battlefield, where it requires
advantageous positions to fire from, and cover for
its horses and ammunition, both often difficult to
find. Artillery is also very dependent on the
weather and the nature of the country for its
action, as it requires clear air and good light, and
an absence of hills and woods, to allow the object
and the effect of its fire to be observed. It also
needs good roads, and is more obstructed by mud,
ice, or snow on the march than are the other Arms.</p>

<h4 id="hdr_12">3. ENGINEERS</h4>

<p>Engineers, as a body of officers with men, were
only introduced towards the end of the eighteenth
century, but officers of that name had been employed
for centuries on the Staff of Armies,
especially at Sieges.</p>

<p>The Engineers are now sometimes styled “The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Fourth Arm of the Service,” not so much because
they are Combatant Troops, armed and trained
like Infantry, as because their work on the battlefield
is of interesting tactical importance.</p>

<p>The work with which Engineers with an Army
in the Field are charged presents great scope and
variety. It may be catalogued under the following
headings:</p>

<h5>(<em>a</em>) WORK WITH THE FIGHTING TROOPS</h5>

<p>Pioneer Work on the march—<i>i.e.</i> making roads
and removing obstacles; water supply; bridging
of every sort; collecting, making, and using boats
and rafts for ferrying.</p>

<p>Field Work on the battlefield—<i>i.e.</i> clearing
the communications and field of fire; marking
ranges; demolitions; obstacles; special earth-work
(ordinary trench-work and gun-pits being made
by the troops who use them).</p>

<p>Searchlights in the field.</p>

<p>Inter-communication Work—<i>i.e.</i> use of telegraphs,
telephones, wireless, visual signalling, kites,
captive balloons.</p>

<p>Aviation by balloon or airship.</p>

<p>Printing and lithography for Orders and Maps.</p>

<h5>(<i>b</i>) WORK IN REAR OF THE FIGHTING TROOPS</h5>

<p>Engineers are also charged with the following
important work on the Lines of Communication:</p>

<p>Construction, repair, maintenance, and working
of railways and telegraphs; provisional fortification
of posts; camping grounds; formation of workshops<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
and depôts of Engineer Stores; hutting and
housing troops; providing hospitals, offices, and
storehouses; water supply; roads. At sea bases,
piers, wharves, and tramways will have to be provided,
and perhaps dredging undertaken, and buoys,
beacons, and lighthouses kept up. Engineers will
also have to run any <dfn>plant</dfn> needed, such as that for
providing ice for hospitals, cold storage, electric
light and power, gas for balloons and lighting.</p>

<p>Engineers are employed in surveying, or mapping
the country passed through by the Army,
when this is required in the wilder theatres of
operations, like the Indian Frontier.</p>

<p>Besides their duties with the Field Army, Engineers
are as necessary as ever for the conduct
of Sieges, and the defence of Fortresses, in which
services they have constantly been employed for
centuries.</p>

<h4 id="hdr_13">4. INFANTRY</h4>

<p>Infantry, now the principal Arm, has in modern
times recovered the place which it held in the
armies of the Ancient World, but lost in the
Middle Ages when Horsemen were the Men-at-Arms,
or the only fighting men worth considering.</p>

<p>Infantry has for three centuries formed the bulk
of every army, being the easiest to raise and train,
and the cheapest to equip and keep up, as well as
the most useful, of all the Arms. On Infantry
falls the brunt of the fighting, and the greatest
toil in marching, while it endures the hardships of
a campaign better than the mounted Arms. It
can be used for attack or defence, in close or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
extended order, on any ground, and in any
weather. Infantry can fight with its <em>fire</em>, at a
distance from the enemy, like Artillery, as well as
by <em>shock</em>, at close quarters, like Cavalry.</p>

<p>But Infantry is slow in movement, and without
Cavalry cannot ascertain the operations of the
enemy, and will therefore be ill-directed in its
own; it is helpless in pursuit, and unable either to
complete a victory or cover a retreat. The action,
too, of Infantry fire is limited to the range of the
rifle and the effect of the bullet, so that it finds
in Artillery a useful auxiliary, owing to the greater
effect of fire from guns, and the distance at
which they can act. Hence Infantry is greatly
assisted in its fighting by associating it with
Cavalry and Artillery, just as Cavalry is aided by
association with Artillery. It is essential, therefore,
that not only every Army, but every Body
of Troops which may have to fight independently,
should have a due proportion of all Arms. This
is the reason for organizing Armies in the <em>higher
Formations</em>, provided with more than one Arm,
as contrasted with the Units composed of <em>one</em> Arm
only. The latter, however, are the basis of the
higher Formations, and their composition and
strength must be considered before describing how
they are grouped into larger bodies. Therefore
the Organization of the Units of each Arm will
form the subject of the next chapter.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="subhead">ORGANIZATION OF THE UNITS OF EACH ARM</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The formations in which each Arm is independently
organized constitute the <dfn>tactical units</dfn> of
an Army. Their strength and organization are
intimately connected with the way in which they
are used in fighting, and have varied little since
armies first became regularly organized.</p>

<p>The general composition of these Units of each
Arm in modern armies will now be described,
beginning with Infantry, the principal Arm.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_14">1. INFANTRY</h3>

<p>Infantry, as will be seen in the historical portion
of this work, used to be of various natures, such
as Guards, Grenadiers, Fusiliers, Rifles, and Light
Infantry, which still survive, but as names only.
Napoleon said he wanted but one sort of Infantry,
and that <em>good Infantry</em>. This aspiration may now
be realized. All Infantry, however designated, is
of one kind only, and works in the same manner
in war.</p>

<p>The formations of Infantry are the <em>Company</em>,
the <em>Battalion</em>, the <em>Regiment</em>, and the <em>Brigade</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span></p>

<h4>THE COMPANY</h4>

<p>The Company, with its three officers—Captain,
Lieutenant, and Ensign—and its Sergeants and
Corporals, has been for centuries the foundation
stone of the organization of Infantry. Its Chief,
the <dfn>Captain</dfn>, is the officer with whom the men are
most intimately associated, as he is responsible
not only for their drill, discipline, and training,
but also for their food, clothing, pay, and lodging.
The men’s confidence in their Captain is grounded
on this responsibility. It is to him that they learn
to look for their well-being, comfort, and redress
of grievances, as well as for praise or blame.
The Captain is thus in daily contact with the men,
and learns to know them, and be known by them.
His influence with his men, owing to these
personal relations, is the keystone of command and
discipline, and makes him their natural leader in
action.</p>

<p>To avoid repetition, it may be here mentioned
that the same remarks apply to the <dfn>Squadron</dfn>
and <dfn>Battery Commanders</dfn>, who, in the Cavalry
and Artillery, hold the same position with regard
to their men as the Captain does in the
Infantry.</p>

<p>The Company is usually divided into <dfn>Half-Companies</dfn>,
commanded by a Lieutenant, and into
four <dfn>Sections</dfn>, each under a Sergeant; but the
German Company has three Sections under a
Lieutenant. The tactical movements of a Company
in action are usually carried out by Sections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<h4>THE BATTALION</h4>

<p>The Battalion of 1,000 men is universally
recognized as the Tactical Unit of Infantry.
Operations are ordered, carried out, and recorded
by Battalions. The Battalion is in modern armies
provided with transport to carry its ammunition
and entrenching tools, as well as its baggage and
immediate supply of food, so as to render it independent.</p>

<p>The Battalion is commanded in foreign armies
by a Major or his equivalent, but in the British
and Russian Services by a Lieutenant-Colonel. The
Battalion Commander is assisted by a Staff Officer,
styled his <dfn>Adjutant</dfn>, and by a small Administrative
Staff.</p>

<p>The number of Companies in a Battalion is, in
the British Service, eight, with 3 officers and 120
men each, but in other armies four, with 4 or 5
officers and 240 men.</p>

<p>The system of dividing the Battalion into a few
large companies was adopted in Prussia during
the eighteenth century so as to economize in
officers, partly to save expense, partly because of
the dearth of men fit for commissions, in the increasing
army of that small country. In the huge
armies of to-day this system commends itself for
the same reasons; while England and the United
States have kept to small companies, with their
original strength of about 100 men. Owing to
the increasing difficulty of exercising control in
battle, small companies give advantages as to
Command. They also provide any necessary detachments,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
such as outposts and advanced guards,
better than large companies, which may have to
be broken up for these purposes. The fact, too,
cannot be overlooked, that in an army of small
companies there are four Captains more per
thousand men, which gives a useful reserve of
officers.</p>

<h4>THE INFANTRY REGIMENT</h4>

<p>Two, three, or four Battalions form a <dfn>Regiment</dfn>,
designated by a number or by a permanent name,
territorial or personal. In the Regiment are embodied
the honourable traditions which have accrued
in history, and the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> engendered by
them. The officers are on one Regimental List for
promotion, and so serve continuously in the Regiment.
They thereby acquire a camaraderie, professional
feeling, and personal intimacy with each
other and with their men, of the greatest value in
war. In foreign armies, with short service of two
years, it is hardly too much to say that the Regimental
Officers really constitute the permanent
army, through which there flows continuously a
stream of recruits, receiving a professional impress
from their officers.</p>

<p>The Regiment is in foreign armies commanded
by a Colonel (with sometimes a Lieutenant-Colonel),
assisted by an Adjutant and a small Administrative
Staff. The British Regiment is merely a peace
organization never found as a whole in war, and the
Battalion, with its Colonel and his Staff, its Colours
and band, its traditions, history, and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">esprit de corps</i>,
represents what in foreign armies we find in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Regiment. The battalions of the foreign Regiment
are merely its tactical units, just as the companies
are to the Battalion.</p>

<h4>THE INFANTRY BRIGADE</h4>

<p>The Brigade is the largest body formed of
Infantry only. In the British Service, where there
is no <em>Regimental</em> organization in war, the Brigade
comprises four battalions. In foreign armies it is
composed of two Regiments (comprising six to
eight battalions), a faulty organization for Command
purposes, as shown in <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I.</a></p>

<p>Brigades are commanded by a Brigadier-General,
with a Staff Officer, who is styled in England the
<dfn>Brigade Major</dfn>.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_15">2. CAVALRY</h3>

<p>Cavalry, like Infantry, was once of many
different natures—“Light,” “Heavy,” Hussars,
Dragoons, Lancers, etc. These names still survive
in the armies of Europe, but the regiments so
designated now form practically only one sort of
Cavalry, and are all trained for identical action in
war, although they still bear their historic names
and uniforms, and keep up the old rivalry of their
corps traditions.</p>

<p>The formations of Cavalry are the <em>Troop</em>, the
<em>Squadron</em>, the <em>Regiment</em>, and the <em>Brigade</em>.</p>

<h4>THE SQUADRON</h4>

<p>The Tactical Unit of Cavalry has since the seventeenth
century been the <dfn>Squadron</dfn> of about 150<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
men. Its strength in different armies now varies
between 130 and 180 men.</p>

<p>The Squadron is divided into four <dfn>Troops</dfn>, each
of which is commanded by a Lieutenant. The
Squadron leader is a Major or a Captain. The
British Squadron has both these officers, and four
Lieutenants.</p>

<h4>THE CAVALRY REGIMENT</h4>

<p>The Regiment is the permanent and administrative
Cavalry Unit, and like the regiment of Infantry,
has its special title or number, its own history and
esprit de corps, and its band.</p>

<p>The number of Squadrons in a Regiment varies
in different armies, there being generally four, but
five in the Italian and Japanese, and six in the
Austrian and Russian Services. There are three in
the British Cavalry at home, but four in the
Yeomanry and also in India. The Regiment thus
forms a body of from 500 to 900 men, and is commanded
by a Colonel, or a Lieutenant-Colonel,
with an Adjutant as Staff Officer, besides a small
Administrative Staff.</p>

<h4>THE CAVALRY BRIGADE</h4>

<p>The Brigade is formed in most armies of two
Regiments, but in the British, American, and Swiss
armies of three—a superior form of organization
for Command, as shown in <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I.</a>, and one
probably better suited for the tactics of Cavalry.</p>

<p>The Brigade is commanded by a Brigadier-General,
with a Staff Officer (or Brigade Major).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_16">3. ARTILLERY</h3>

<p>Artillery is of many descriptions, differing in
the guns they use, and their functions in war.
Only that brought into the field with an army, as
distinguished from Siege, Fortress, and Coast
Artillery, will be here described. It may be
divided into <em>Field Artillery</em>, <em>Heavy Artillery</em>,
and <em>Mountain Artillery</em>.</p>

<h4>FIELD ARTILLERY</h4>

<p>Field Artillery in the most general sense means
the Mounted Branch of the Arm, which possesses
mobility, so as to accompany the other Arms. Its
personnel does not march on foot, so that the
guns can move at a pace beyond the walk, when
desired. It comprises <dfn>Field Artillery</dfn> proper, or
that armed with the Field Gun (or Field Howitzer)
and <em>Horse Artillery</em>.</p>

<p><dfn>Field Guns</dfn> form the larger portion of all
Artillery in the field. They fire mainly shrapnel,
or shell containing small round bullets which
are very effective against the enemy’s men and
horses, but useless against material objects. In
foreign armies they have therefore a small amount
of shell filled with high explosive, in addition
to the shrapnel.</p>

<p><dfn>Field Howitzers</dfn> use high-angle fire, giving a large
angle of descent, so that they can search out the
enemy’s trenches. They are provided with high-explosive
shell in addition to shrapnel, so as to
destroy masonry and field works, which the shrapnel
of field guns cannot injure.</p>

<p>Both these varieties of Field Artillery have their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
Officers and Sergeants mounted, and carry their
men seated on the gun limbers, or on the wagons,
so that they can move at a trot.</p>

<p><dfn>Horse Artillery</dfn> is provided for supporting
Cavalry in action. It is armed with a lighter
nature of field gun, and has its personnel mounted,
so as to be very mobile. It can keep up with
Cavalry both on the march and in action, and
can move at the gallop when required.</p>

<h4>HEAVY ARTILLERY</h4>

<p>This comprises the heaviest guns and howitzers
having sufficient mobility to accompany an army
in the field. It uses shell filled with a high
explosive, as well as a large shrapnel, and is therefore
effective against field works and masonry as
well as against men and horses. It differs from
Field Artillery in having less mobility, but longer
range and much greater effect. It generally comes
into action at long ranges, and changes its position
as little as possible in action. It will be very
effective against the enemy’s artillery and field
works, and its great range will allow it to bring
oblique fire on the vital portions of his line.</p>

<p>Heavy Artillery is manned by the non-mounted
Branch, called <dfn>Garrison Artillery</dfn> in England, and
<dfn>Foot Artillery</dfn> abroad. It requires eight-horse
teams, and moves only at a walk, the men marching
on foot.</p>

<h4>MOUNTAIN ARTILLERY</h4>

<p>Artillery carried on pack animals is used in
hilly, enclosed, or rough country, where wheels<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
cannot pass. It is the weakest form of Artillery
in shell-power, as it is armed with a light gun,
which can be carried on a pack mule. A heavier
gun can be carried, if formed of two parts, each
about 200 lb. weight, or a load for one mule,
which can be jointed together for action. The
gun carriages, ammunition, and stores are also
carried on mules, and the personnel marches on
foot, and is provided from the “Foot” (or
“Garrison”) Artillery. The slowness of Mountain
compared to Field Artillery is compensated
in broken country by its ability to take cover,
and to come into action in places inaccessible
to Field Guns, so that it can support Infantry
more closely.</p>

<h4>THE BATTERY</h4>

<p>The Tactical Unit of Artillery is the <dfn>Battery</dfn>, of
4, 6, or 8 guns, with 1 to 3 Ammunition Wagons
to each gun. Field guns and wagons have six-horse
teams; Heavy Artillery has eight-horse
teams.</p>

<p>In France, Switzerland, Turkey and the United
States all Batteries are of 4 guns.</p>

<p>In other armies all Field and Horse Artillery
Batteries are of 6 guns, except in Austria, where
Horse Artillery has 4-gun Batteries, and in Russia,
where Field Batteries have 8 guns.</p>

<p>Heavy Batteries have generally 4 guns, owing
to the number of wagons required to carry a
sufficient amount of their heavy ammunition.</p>

<p>Mountain Batteries have 4 guns, except in
Russia, where they have 8.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
The Battery in all armies has a strength of from
130 to 200 men and horses. It is divided into
<dfn>Sections</dfn> of 2 guns with their wagons, commanded
by a Lieutenant, and these into <dfn>Sub-Sections</dfn>
under a Sergeant. The <dfn>Battery Commander</dfn>
is a Captain, except in the Russian Service, where
he is a Lieutenant-Colonel, and in the British
Service, where he is a Major, with a Captain as
Second-in-Command to take charge of the Ammunition
Supply in action. To assist the Battery
Commander in action, he has a Staff comprising
trumpeters, rangetakers, observers, signallers,
mounted orderlies, scouts, and horse-holders.
There is also a small Administrative Staff, including
artificers for repair of harness and carriages.</p>

<h4>THE ARTILLERY BRIGADE</h4>

<p>Batteries are grouped into larger Units, called in
the British Service <dfn>Brigades</dfn>. They are commanded
by a Lieutenant-Colonel, with an Adjutant, and a
Staff for purposes of observation and command,
including telephone and signalling detachments,
rangetakers, and orderlies. This Unit is called an
<dfn>Abteilung</dfn> in Germany, a <dfn>Groupe</dfn> in France, a
<dfn>Division</dfn> in Russia and Austria, and a <dfn>Battalion</dfn> in
Japan and the United States. It comprises as a
rule three batteries of Field Guns, or of Howitzers
(or two batteries of Horse Artillery), with an Ammunition
Column. Heavy Batteries in the British
Service are not brigaded, but one, with its own
Ammunition Column, forms part of the Artillery
of each Division. In foreign armies they are
grouped by twos or fours into <dfn>Battalions</dfn>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<h4>HIGHER UNITS OF ARTILLERY</h4>

<p>In foreign armies the above Units of three
batteries are grouped by pairs into <dfn>Artillery Regiments</dfn>,
commanded by a Colonel with a Staff.
The Divisional Artillery and the Corps Artillery
are respectively formed of one or more Regiments.</p>

<p>Two Artillery Regiments are in some armies
grouped into an <dfn>Artillery Brigade</dfn>, which forms
the Divisional or Corps Artillery, and is commanded
by a General with a Staff.</p>

<h4>AMMUNITION COLUMNS</h4>

<p><dfn>Ammunition Columns</dfn> form an integral part of
the Artillery, but they carry ammunition for
Infantry as well as for the guns. They are Fighting
Units, because the replenishment of ammunition
is a function of the Fighting Troops, and the
movements of Ammunition Columns are tactical
operations. The Ammunition Columns belonging
to Units of Artillery provide the first reserve of
ammunition. The second reserve of ammunition
is provided by <dfn>Divisional Ammunition Columns</dfn>,
which in foreign armies form the <dfn>Divisional Ammunition
Park</dfn>. There is in large armies also an
<dfn>Army Corps Ammunition Park</dfn> comprising several
Columns, and an <dfn>Army Ammunition Park</dfn>, behind
which are the <dfn>Ammunition Depôts</dfn> on the L. of C.</p>

<p>The Ammunition Columns constitute also a
reserve to draw on for officers, men, teams, and
matériel, to replace the losses of the Batteries.
In Manchuria, the men of the Ammunition Columns
were, within twelve months, all absorbed by the
Batteries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
An Ammunition Column comprises about 150
to 200 men and as many horses, with from 20 to
30 ammunition wagons.</p>

<h4>BRITISH AMMUNITION SUPPLY</h4>

<p>In the British Service the organization of the
Ammunition Supply is as follows:</p>

<p>The Field Battery and Horse Artillery ammunition
wagons carry 176 rounds per gun, those of
a Howitzer Battery 88, and of a Heavy Battery
76 rounds per gun.</p>

<p>The Ammunition Column of each Field Artillery
Brigade carries 200 rounds per gun for its Brigade.
It carries also rifle ammunition (100 rounds per
rifle) for one Infantry Brigade. The Horse Artillery
Ammunition Column carries a supply of rifle
ammunition (100 rounds per rifle) for the Mounted
Troops, in addition to gun ammunition at the
rate of 220 rounds per gun.</p>

<p>The Ammunition Column of a Howitzer Brigade,
and that of a Heavy Battery, which have to carry
heavier gun-ammunition, at the rate of 70 and
98 rounds per gun respectively, carry no rifle
ammunition.</p>

<p>The Divisional Ammunition Column is divided
into 4 Sections, giving three for the three Field
Artillery Brigades (carrying 120 rounds per gun),
and one Section with ammunition for the Howitzer
Brigade (92 rounds per gun) and for the Heavy
Battery (80 rounds per gun), and also for a proportion
of the guns with the Mounted Troops. Each
of the first three Sections carries a reserve of 100
rounds per rifle for one Infantry Brigade. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
fourth Section, having heavier gun-ammunition to
carry, is not burdened with any rifle ammunition.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The number of rounds of ammunition with the
Force in the field is as follows:</p>

<h6>ROUNDS PER MACHINE GUN</h6>

<p>Ammunition for Machine Guns with Infantry is
allotted as follows: With each gun, 3,500 rounds;
in Regimental Reserve, 8,000; in Brigade Ammunition
Column, 10,000; in Divisional Ammunition
Column, 10,000. Guns with Cavalry have the
same, except twice as much in Regimental Reserve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_17">4. ENGINEERS</h3>

<p>Engineers are allotted to the larger formations
of all Arms in the field, to carry out the varied
work required with the troops at the front, as
described in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II.</a></p>

<p>In foreign armies they are organized in Companies
belonging to the Engineer Battalion of the
Army Corps, and one Company is allotted to
each Division, and one to the Corps Troops. Its
strength is that of the Infantry Company (250
men), under a Captain, with three or four officers.
In order that its tools and stores shall accompany
it and be at hand for work, each Company has
transport allotted to it from the “Train Battalion”
of the Army Corps. The Cavalry Division has
generally some Engineers, who are mounted or
carried on wagons, so as to keep up with the
Division.</p>

<p>A reserve of tools and equipment for the
Companies is carried by a column of wagons
called the <dfn>Army Corps Engineer Park</dfn>.</p>

<p>In the British Service there are with each
Division two <dfn>Field Companies</dfn> of Engineers, each
having 156 working sappers, and with the Cavalry
Division four <dfn>Field Troops</dfn>, each with 40 working
sappers, half of whom are mounted, half carried
on the tool carts. Thus, if a Cavalry Brigade is
detached, it can take with it a Field Troop of
Engineers. The drivers and transport are integral
portions of the Engineer Troops and Companies.</p>

<p><dfn>Telegraph Companies</dfn> of Engineers are in all
armies allotted to each Command for inter-communication<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
purposes. Those of the British Service
are described later among the Administrative
Services, in <a href="#CHAPTER_IX">Chapter IX.</a></p>

<p>Another Unit of Engineers is the <dfn>Bridging Train</dfn>,
which supplements the small bridge equipment
carried by the Engineer Field Companies. In
foreign armies these Trains are manned by
Engineers, but horsed by the “Train,” and one is
allotted to each Division and Army Corps. In
the British Service the Bridging Trains are “Army
Troops,” and are not allotted to Divisions.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="subhead">NEW VARIETIES OF FIGHTING TROOPS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It was mentioned in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II.</a> that of late years
there have been added to modern armies a number
of new varieties of troops, which it is not possible
to group under the old heads of the Three Arms.</p>

<p>These varieties may be described under the
following heads:</p>

<div class="container"><div class="ilb">
1. Mounted Infantry.<br />
2. Mountain Infantry.<br />
3. Mountain Artillery.<br />
4. Machine Guns.<br />
5. Cavalry Pioneers.<br />
6. Cyclists and Motor Cars.<br />
7. Scouts.<br />
8. Field Orderlies.<br />
9. Military Police.
</div></div>

<p>A short description of the functions and organization
of these troops will now be given.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_18">1. <span class="smcap">Mounted Infantry</span></h3>

<p>Mounted Infantry is to-day what Dragoons were
when first introduced—that is, Infantry mounted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
only so as to be quickly moved to a point where
it is to fight on foot. Mounted Infantry is armed
only with the rifle, and is neither trained nor
armed for shock action on horseback.</p>

<p>The introduction of Mounted Infantry was advocated
long ago by Jomini in his “Art of War”
(Vol. ii., chap. viii., sect. 45), but up to now this
Arm only exists in the British Service, and there
it is only organized in war, when Mounted Infantry
Battalions are formed of men from Infantry
Battalions trained for the purpose in peace.</p>

<p>British Mounted Infantry is organized in Battalions
of 3 Companies with a Machine-Gun
Section, Units of identical strength with the <em>Cavalry</em>
Regiment, Squadron, and Machine-Gun Section.</p>

<p>Mounted Infantry is employed in two capacities
in the British Service:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) In the <dfn>Mounted Brigades</dfn>, in which it acts
with Cavalry, whose shock action it supports by
its fire.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) As <dfn>Divisional Mounted Troops</dfn>, which are
used as Advanced Guards and Outposts for protection;
as Patrols for reconnaissance; as Escorts
for Head-Quarters, Batteries, and Trains; for keeping
connection, both with the Cavalry in front and
with adjoining Divisions; for internal communication
in their own Division.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_19">2. <span class="smcap">Mountain Infantry</span></h3>

<p>Infantry Battalions specially trained and equipped
for mountain fighting, like the “Alpine Troops” of
France and Italy, are kept up in foreign countries,
where warfare may, as often in the past, be carried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
on in difficult mountain regions. Switzerland and
Austria have Mounted Infantry Battalions formed
into Brigades, to which Mountain Batteries are
attached. Austria has organized <dfn>Mountain Transport
Squadrons</dfn> for these Brigades.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_20">3. <span class="smcap">Mountain Artillery</span></h3>

<p>The Arm is described under the head of Artillery,
in <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III.</a> It is provided for mountain
fighting in India, France, Austria, Russia, Switzerland,
and the United States, and in the “Highlands”
Division of the British Territorial Army.
In Austria there are Mountain <em>howitzers</em> as well
as <em>guns</em>.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_21">4. <span class="smcap">Machine Guns</span></h3>

<p>Every nation has now introduced Machine Guns
as a valuable auxiliary to Cavalry and Infantry.
The intention, not as yet fully carried out, is to
form a Unit of two Machine Guns in every Cavalry
Regiment and in every Battalion (or at least in
every Regiment) of Infantry. In the German
and some other armies these guns will be taken
away from their Units and grouped by sixes into
“sections,” which will be virtually independent
batteries of machine guns.</p>

<p>In the British Service a Section of two Machine
Guns is provided by every Cavalry Regiment and
Infantry Battalion. These guns, which fire from
tripods, are carried in wagons with four horses
in Cavalry Sections, for rapidity of movement, and
with two horses in Infantry Sections. The Section
is commanded by one of the Lieutenants, with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
Sergeant, a Corporal, and the necessary drivers.
To each gun there are six men, who are of course
mounted in the Cavalry Section.</p>

<p>The Germans have adopted the Battery formation.
The <dfn>Mounted Section</dfn>, for use with the
Cavalry Division, consists of 6 guns on four-horsed
carriages, with 3 ammunition wagons. The
strength is 1 Lieutenant, 130 men, 90 horses.
The officer and sergeant are mounted, and the
men are carried on the gun carriage. The <dfn>Foot
Section</dfn> forms an extra Company, the 13th, of each
Infantry Regiment. It has 6 guns on two-horsed
carriages, with 3 ammunition wagons. The
strength is 1 Lieutenant, 83 men, 28 draught horses.
The officer and 3 N.C.O.’s are mounted; the men
march on foot, and are armed with pistols.</p>

<p>In Japan, there is to be a 6-gun Section to each
Infantry Regiment, with a strength of 1 Officer,
1 W.O., 6 N.C.O.’s, 36 men. Guns and ammunition
are carried on 30 pack horses. There will be
an 8-gun Section to each Cavalry Brigade, with
a strength of 3 Officers, 87 men.</p>

<p>In Switzerland a Machine-Gun Battery takes
the place of Horse Artillery with Cavalry. It
consists of 8 guns, and is carried on pack mules,
with its personnel mounted.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_22">5. <span class="smcap">Cavalry Pioneers</span></h3>

<p>In the Austrian Service a few men from each
Cavalry Squadron have long been trained to perform
Engineers’ duties, such as demolitions and
repair of bridges, railways, and telegraphs, and hasty
field works. This plan has been adopted to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
limited extent in the British Cavalry, where a
corporal and four men of each Squadron are trained
in Pioneer duties. The German Cavalry Regiment
has a Bridging equipment of 4 Pontoons, to form
small bridges, or rafts, and a Demolition equipment
carried in the Pontoon wagons, with men
of the Regiment trained to use both.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_23">6. <span class="smcap">Cyclists and Motor Cars</span></h3>

<p>Cyclist Infantry have been introduced into some
armies, to carry Orders and messages. They will
relieve Cavalry of part of their orderly, scouting,
and patrolling work, as they can move as rapidly
as mounted men, as long as the roads are good.
Besides these duties it is claimed that Cyclists can
also be used for fighting. Being armed as Infantry,
but more rapid in movement, they could be used
like mounted Infantry, to surprise the enemy with
rifle fire from distant and unexpected places, or to
seize and hold important tactical points, such as
bridges, defiles, and hills, before the Infantry can
reach them. As yet, however, it cannot be said
that any decision has been arrived at as to the
organization, equipment, and sphere of utility of
Cyclists, or their employment as fighting troops.</p>

<p>In the British Service it is expected that each
Unit will furnish a few Cyclists, and there are
bicycles allotted to each Head-Quarters, to every
Unit of fighting troops, and to telegraph companies,
for inter-communication purposes. The
Territorial Army has, besides 12 Cyclists per
battalion, ten Cyclist Battalions.</p>

<p>The French, who were the first to form Military<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
Cyclists, have a few companies, each of 4 Officers
and 175 men.</p>

<p>The Germans provide 19 Cyclists from each
Infantry Regiment, 9 from each Artillery Regiment,
and 6 from each Cavalry Regiment. The
latter will probably be massed as one body in the
Cavalry Division, for transmitting intelligence.</p>

<p>Austria has a Volunteer Cyclist Corps for each
Army Corps, and two Companies of Cyclists are
to be attached to each Cavalry Division for use as
fighting troops.</p>

<p>Italy has 24 Cyclists per Infantry Regiment,
and two Battalions of Bersaglieri (or Rifles) are
organized as Cyclists.</p>

<h4>MOTOR CAR SERVICE IN WAR</h4>

<p>Motor Cars will be much used in war for conveyance
of Generals and Staff Officers on the
march and in action, as the power of covering the
ground rapidly is of great advantage to Command
of Troops, enabling what is passing at a distance to
be seen, and decisions to be made and communicated
without delay.</p>

<p>There will be great scope for Motors in carrying
supplies to the troops from railhead, thus rendering
the daily supply far more certain, and obviating
blocking the roads with long trains of wagons.
This system is being organized on the Continent.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_24">7. <span class="smcap">Scouts</span></h3>

<p>Scouts are men whose function is to reconnoitre
the ground, or the enemy, without fighting. They
are soldiers selected for intelligence, activity, self-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>reliance,
and powers of observation. (“Infantry
Training,” 1905, p. 73.)</p>

<p>Scouts are taken from Infantry Battalions,
Cavalry Regiments, or Batteries, and work in the
neighbourhood of their own Corps and for its
immediate benefit. They move out generally in
pairs, so that one man may take back information,
if signalling is not possible.</p>

<p>In the British Service the numbers of Scouts
are:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>Infantry: 1 N.C.O. and 6 men per Company,
of whom 1 Sergeant and 16 men per
Battalion are First-Class Scouts.</p>

<p>Cavalry: 1 Officer, as Scout Leader, 1 Sergeant,
24 men, per Regiment.</p>

<p>Artillery: One or two “Ground Scouts” in front
of the Battery when it is manœuvring.
Two “Look-out Men” close to the Battery
in action.</p></blockquote>

<p>German Cavalry has 1 N.C.O. and 2 men per
Squadron as Ground Scouts, and 1 Officer per
Regiment in charge of them.</p>

<p>In France 12 mounted Ground Scouts, “Eclaireurs
de terrain montés d’infanterie,” are to be
attached to each Infantry Regiment.</p>

<p>The Russians in Manchuria used volunteers
from Infantry Regiments as mounted Scouts, with
good results.</p>

<p>Corps of Scouts and Guides have been formed
from time to time, as in the American Civil War,
and lately in Canada. They cannot, however, be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
said to have any actual existence in organized
armies, but will probably be extemporized in war.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_25">8. <span class="smcap">Field Orderlies</span></h3>

<p>Wellington organized in the Peninsula a Corps
of Guides and a Mounted Staff Corps, who acted as
despatch riders and police. Napoleon had similar
corps, and their usefulness is obvious. But it may
be doubted if the multiplication of small special
corps is not objectionable and wasteful of men and
horses. Modern practice tends to allot the carrying
of messages and Orders to orderlies furnished at
Head-Quarters of Commands, either by Cyclists,
by the men of the Cavalry escort, or by the Mounted
Police.</p>

<p>The Germans have always had at Head-Quarters
a small corps of <dfn>Feldjägers</dfn>, or mounted orderlies,
for carrying despatches, and have now formed a
body of motor-cycle volunteers for this purpose.</p>

<p>In the British Cavalry Division, four men from
every squadron are trained as despatch riders, and
Officers of the “Motor Reserve,” with their cars,
are attached to every Head-Quarters, for carrying
Orders and messages.</p>

<p>There is a <dfn>Courier Corps</dfn> in the Russian Service,
which provides one section of 4 Officers and 6
N.C.O.’s for each Army Corps Head-Quarters.
Two sections are allotted to Army Commands.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_26">9. <span class="smcap">Military Police</span></h3>

<p>A body of <dfn>Police</dfn> is now a necessity for an
Army. They comprise <dfn>Mounted</dfn>, as well as <dfn>Foot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
Police</dfn>. Their duties are to enforce sanitary regulations,
to preserve order, especially in rear of the
Army, and to carry out sentences of Courts-Martial.
They ensure regularity in allotting
billets and enforcing requisitions. They control
sutlers and civilians with the Army, protect civil
property, prevent marauding, and arrest stragglers,
deserters, and spies. During action they will be
useful in clearing roads, and maintaining order in
rear of the fighting, and later will keep off the
ghouls who infest the battlefield to plunder the
dead and kill the wounded.</p>

<p>Small detachments of Military Police are in the
British Service attached to all Head-Quarters,
under the orders of the Assistant-Provost-Marshal.
Foot Police will be attached to General Head-Quarters
and those of the L. of C.; Mounted Police
to all other Head-Quarters; while at Base Head-Quarters
there will be both.</p>

<span class="subhead">FORMATIONS OF ALL ARMS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The Larger Formations are formed by combining in
one body a number of the Smaller Formations
composed of Units of each Arm, together with the
Administrative Units required for their service.
The body thus formed is then provided with
<dfn>Head-Quarters</dfn>, comprising the Commander and his
Staff, and other necessary personnel. The numbers
of Units and of Lesser Formations grouped together,
and their proportion to each other, are
dictated by past experience and a forecast of
future fighting requirements.</p>

<p>The bodies thus formed constitute what are
called the <dfn>Subordinate Commands</dfn> of the Army.
They are self-contained, and capable of independent
existence and action—<i>existence</i>, because
they have the necessary Administrative Services
to supply their wants; <i>action</i>, because, having
considerable strength, and a proper proportion of
all Arms, they can fight for a certain time without
support from other bodies of troops.</p>

<p>In this chapter will be discussed these <em>Subordinate
Commands</em> and the <em>Administrative Services</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
allotted to them. The succeeding chapter will
describe their <em>Staff</em> and the composition of their
<em>Head-Quarters</em>.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_27">1. <span class="smcap">The Division</span></h3>

<p>The <dfn>Division</dfn> is the basis of the higher organization
of Armies in the Field. It may be mainly
composed of Infantry or of Cavalry. In the
former case it is generally termed simply a
<em>Division</em>, in the latter a <dfn>Cavalry Division</dfn>. Its
Commander is generally a Major-General, and is
provided with a Staff, to which the Heads of the
Divisional Administrative Services are attached.</p>

<p>Divisions are organized on the following general
lines in various armies:</p>

<h4>THE INFANTRY DIVISION</h4>

<p>The <dfn>Infantry Division</dfn> is formed of two or
three Infantry Brigades—that is, of 12, 16, or 18
Battalions. The “two-Brigade” organization, the
most common abroad, is inferior to that of the
British Army in three Brigades, for the reasons
already discussed in the first chapter. The
Division is furnished with other Arms to assist
the action of the Infantry, and has generally the
following:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p><dfn>Cavalry</dfn>: 1 Regiment, or sometimes only 2
Squadrons.</p>

<p><dfn>Artillery</dfn>: 4 to 12 Batteries, organized in Brigades,
and with the Brigades sometimes
grouped in Regiments. One or other of
these formations has an ammunition column.
The larger number of guns is allotted when,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
as in Germany and England, no Army
Corps Artillery exists.</p>

<p><dfn>Engineers</dfn>: A Field Company.</p>

<p><dfn>Administrative Services</dfn>: Ammunition Columns;
Supply Columns; Field Ambulances; a Field
Post Office.</p></blockquote>

<p>In some armies the Division has also a light
Bridging Train; a Field Hospital; a mobile
Remount Depôt; a Finance Office; Chaplains.</p>

<p>The Divisional <dfn>Head-Quarters</dfn> comprise, besides
the Commander and his Staff, a number of Heads
of Administrative Services, a Telegraph Company,
or “Communication Unit,” Military Police, and
the necessary Transport.</p>

<h4>THE CAVALRY DIVISION</h4>

<p>The <dfn>Cavalry Division</dfn> is formed of two or three
Cavalry Brigades—that is, of 16 to 24 Squadrons,
in foreign armies. It has also one Brigade of
Horse Artillery of 12 guns, with its ammunition
column, and generally some Mounted Engineers
and a Telegraph Detachment.</p>

<p>The British Cavalry Division has 4 Brigades or
36 Squadrons; 2 <em>Brigades</em> of Horse Artillery—that
is, 4 Batteries, or 24 guns; 4 <em>Field Troops</em> of
Engineers; and a <em>Wireless Telegraph Company</em> in
four sections. It is obvious that by this organization
a Brigade can be furnished with all Units it
requires for independent action when detached.</p>

<p>Cavalry Divisions are furnished with the following
Administrative Units: <em>A Supply Column</em>;
<em>Field Ambulances</em>; <em>Field Post Office</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_28">2. <span class="smcap">The Army Corps</span></h3>

<h4>MEANING OF THE TERM</h4>

<p>This word is a somewhat misleading translation
of the original French term <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Corps d’Armée</i>, which
means one of the bodies of troops forming an
army, whereas the English term (which came
through the German <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Armee Korps</i>) might be supposed
to mean a Corps which is an army in itself.
It is now generally shortened to <dfn>Corps</dfn>.</p>

<h4>REASON FOR ORGANIZATION BY ARMY CORPS</h4>

<p>If the Army is very large, there must be an
intermediate link in the chain of Command
between its Commander and the Divisions, or
there would be too many Subordinate Commanders
for the Army Commander to direct
effectively. This link is provided in the larger
armies of the Continent by the <dfn>Army Corps</dfn>, formed
of two or more Infantry Divisions. A similar
grouping of some of the Cavalry Divisions into
<dfn>Cavalry Corps</dfn> may be occasionally found in war.</p>

<p>Jomini pointed out (“Art de la Guerre,”
Vol. ii., chap, vii.), and Clausewitz (“On War,”
Book V., chap, v.) endorsed his view, that, for
armies up to 100,000 strong, a <dfn>Divisional</dfn> organization
was best. This strength represents five or
six Divisions, and one or two Cavalry Divisions,
which may therefore be considered as the maximum
number which an army should comprise, if
organized in Divisions only.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
The advantages of the <dfn>Army Corps</dfn> organization
of armies are that the Supreme Command is
facilitated by there being fewer Units to direct,
and that a <em>few</em> important Commanders can be
better selected than a number. This organization
also provides a large independent force, under a
Senior Commander, available for any special
mission. There were periods in the South
African War when the temporary employment of
several Divisions for a special purpose would have
been more effective had they formed a permanent
organization like an Army Corps, with its own
Commander and Staff. At the same time it is
undoubtedly true that, except when unavoidable,
the addition of another step in the gradation of
Command is undesirable for many reasons. It is
wasteful in Staff; it tends to delay the transmission
of Orders; and the large strength of the
Army Corps gives their Commanders so much
importance as to lead to considerable independence
in their action, which may weaken the Supreme
Command.</p>

<p>In large armies, however, organization by Army
Corps is unavoidable. We therefore naturally
find the forces of the great military powers of
Europe—Germany, France, Russia, Austria,
Italy—organized by <em>Army Corps</em>, while the forces
of Turkey, Japan, Great Britain, and the smaller
nations of Europe are organized by <em>Divisions</em>
only. Switzerland is about to comply with this
principle by transforming her present Army Corps
into Divisions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<h4>COMPOSITION OF AN ARMY CORPS</h4>

<p>An Army Corps is generally composed, after
the German model, of two Divisions, in spite of
the ruling of Clausewitz that a division of any
Unit into two parts is the worst possible. This is
admitted by von der Golz in his “Nation in Arms,”
and also by von Schellendorf in his “Duties of the
General Staff.” Both agree that an Army Corps
should have <em>three</em> Divisions, but think that it would
be difficult to alter a system so deeply rooted
in Germany. This criticism applies also to the
bipartite organization of both Cavalry and Infantry
Divisions and Brigades, which exists in most
Continental armies. The Austrians have therefore
adopted a Corps of three Divisions, and the Germans
and French think of adding a Reserve Division to
the two forming their Army Corps. To have three
Divisions would undoubtedly strengthen the
Command of the <em>Corps</em>, and, by reducing the
number of Corps, facilitate that of the <em>Army</em>.</p>

<p>Besides the Infantry Divisions, there are other
troops in an Army Corps—namely, Cavalry,
Artillery, Engineers, and Administrative Services.</p>

<p><dfn>Corps Cavalry.</dfn>—The French have a <em>Brigade</em> of
Corps Cavalry, the Russians a <em>Division</em>. This is
probably a better arrangement for providing
“protective Cavalry” than to rely only on the few
squadrons of <em>Divisional</em> Cavalry, as in Germany
and Austria.</p>

<p><dfn>Corps Artillery.</dfn>—German and Russian Army
Corps have no Corps Artillery; other armies have
two or more Brigades, organized in Regiments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
Heavy Artillery is likely to be allotted to Army
Corps or perhaps to Armies, in foreign armies, as it
is in England to the Division.</p>

<p><dfn>Corps Engineers.</dfn>—A Company or two, with an
Engineer Park of tools and stores, a Bridging Train,
and Telegraph Units, form the Corps Engineers.</p>

<p>The <dfn>Corps Administrative Services</dfn> comprise in
most armies an Ammunition Park, a Supply Park,
a Field Bakery, Field Hospitals, and a Remount
and Veterinary Depôt.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_29">3. <span class="smcap">Cavalry Corps</span></h3>

<p>It has been suggested that the duty of strategic
reconnaissance, for which the Cavalry Divisions are
organized, might be better performed if these were
grouped under one Command; but such a permanent
combination of Cavalry Divisions into Corps
has only been carried out in Russia, where there is
one Cavalry Corps of 2 Divisions (48 squadrons), or
7,000 sabres and 24 guns. The British Cavalry
Division, however, of 4 Brigades (36 squadrons and
24 guns) is virtually a Cavalry Corps, except that
its internal organization is by <em>Brigades</em> and not by
<em>Divisions</em>, and so avoids the evil of bipartite
division. An improvised Corps of 2 Divisions has
been tried in German manœuvres, and it is
expected that in war one or more of them will be
formed. They will perhaps be kept in the hands
of the Supreme Command for independent action,
each Army Commander retaining a Division or two
as “Army Cavalry.”</p>

<p>To group 2 or 3 Divisions into a Cavalry Corps
under one Command makes it easier and quicker to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
concentrate them and break through the enemy’s
screen, as long as all the Divisions are moving in
the same direction, and engaged in the same task.
But if they are covering a broad front, and acting on
separate objectives, it would be a mistake to group
them under one Commander, who must necessarily
be acting at some distance. In this case, the
independence of the Divisional Commanders will
conduce to the quick tactical decisions on which
success depends.</p>

<p>It would seem sound not to distribute the whole
of a large Cavalry force equally among the Divisions,
nor the latter equally among the Armies,
but to allot according to the capacity of the Commanders,
and the importance of the strategical
work they have to accomplish. If this be so, there
may be something to be said for the French
Divisions of unequal strength, some of 2, some of 3
Brigades. But in the opinion of von Bernhardi,
the leading exponent of modern Cavalry views, even
the usual Continental Division of 3 Brigades is
“much too weak,” seeing that the Brigades are of
two Regiments. He strongly advocates a three-Regiment
Brigade, which is that of the British
Service.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_30">4. <span class="smcap">The Army as a Unit</span></h3>

<p>The Military Forces of the Great Powers have
now grown so large that a further development of
organization has become necessary. They are
therefore divided in war into separate <em>Armies</em>.
<dfn>Army</dfn>, in this new sense, does not mean, as it used
to, the whole Force, for which, indeed, some other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
word than “Army” is urgently needed. An <em>Army</em>
is simply the highest Unit in the organization of a
great host in the field.</p>

<p>This division into separate Armies, each forming
a definite Unit, with its own Commander and Staff,
and numbered from right to left, was first seen in
the two great wars carried on by Prussia in 1866
and 1870. Each Army had its own Lines of
Communication, and moved and fought independently
under its Commander, in obedience
to general instructions issued at intervals by
Moltke, as Chief of the General Staff, on the
authority of the Commander-in-Chief, the
King of Prussia.</p>

<p>This system was followed in Manchuria by the
Japanese, who had four, and later five, Armies in
the field under one Supreme Command. It is now
obligatory on all nations putting several hundred
thousand men in the field to organize them in
separate Armies. In any future war between
France and Germany each Power will probably form
five such Armies under one Supreme Commander,
or “Generalissimo,” as the French (following
Jomini) style him. Each Army will have its
own sphere of action and Lines of Communication.</p>

<p>The modern organization by Armies differs from
that adopted by Napoleon for the invasion of
Russia, and in the German campaign which followed
in 1813. It is true that, by forming large
detachments to the flanks, he divided his enormous
forces into what were practically separate Armies;
but the main body in the centre was not only by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
far the most important, but was under Napoleon’s
own command. In fact he commanded one of the
Armies himself, while at the same time directing
the whole Force. It is now recognized that this
arrangement was far from successful, even under
Napoleon, and would be impossible for a lesser
man. The Supreme Commander must not himself
command one of his Armies. If he were to
attempt this, the other Armies would become
merely large detachments; plans would tend to be
based on the movements of the main body; and the
operations of the Armies would lose in scope and
independence.</p>

<p>The size of Armies must obviously be limited to
the number which one man can command. This,
according to Clausewitz, should not exceed 120,000
to 150,000. The total strength depends mainly on
the number of Subordinate Commands. Napoleon
was of opinion that five were enough for one man
to command. Clausewitz laid down eight as the
maximum.</p>

<p>In the great hosts of modern nations <em>Armies</em> are
not organized in peace, and their composition in
war is kept secret, but it is certain that they will
not consist of less than three, or of more than six
<em>Army Corps</em> (or <em>Divisions</em>, where Army Corps are
not used), and most probably of four or five, with
two or three <em>Cavalry Divisions</em>.</p>

<p>We have thus traced the development of the
<em>Higher Commands</em>, or those of all Arms, from
the <em>Division</em> to the <em>Army</em>, and will now consider
the Administrative Services and Staff allotted to
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_31">THE ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES</h3>

<p>As indicated at the beginning of the second
chapter, a number of Administrative Services are
required, to provide the Fighting Troops with all
they need to keep up their strength and efficiency.
An army cannot act without a service of communication
for transmission of Orders; it cannot exist
without a supply of food and clothing, fight without
ammunition, or move without transport to
carry these stores. To maintain its discipline
there must be Police, and a department of Military
Justice. For reasons of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">morale</i>, the sick and
wounded must be collected and tended, and it
is also desirable that its letters should pass with
regularity to and from home, and that spiritual
ministration should be provided.</p>

<p>These points, with the exception of the Medical
Services, were as a rule little considered until the
close of the eighteenth century, when Carnot
devoted much attention to them while organizing
the revolutionary armies in France. Napoleon and
Wellington improved them considerably, but they
were still very inadequate in England till after the
Crimean War.</p>

<p>In modern armies a good system of administration
is universally felt to be of the greatest importance.
Services are therefore organized to meet the administrative
requirements of an army in the field,
which may be classed under the following heads:</p>

<p>Inter-communication throughout the Force.</p>

<p>Supply of food, ammunition, and other stores.</p>

<p>Transport by rail and road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
Medical and Veterinary aid.</p>

<p>Replacing loss in men or horses.</p>

<p>The above bear directly on the fighting; but
there are also certain semi-civil services, which
cannot well be dispensed with in war. These deal
with the following matters:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>Guidance as to Law—military, martial, and international.</p>

<p>Finance, Accounts, the provision and issue of
Cash.</p>

<p>Clerical work, in connection with Statistics,
Records, invaliding sick and wounded, etc.</p>

<p>Postal Service.</p>

<p>Spiritual ministration.</p></blockquote>

<h4>ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES IN FOREIGN ARMIES</h4>

<p>It is not possible to investigate here the various
methods adopted in each foreign army to meet
these requirements. The system is generally that
the <em>Medical Services</em> are managed by their own
Heads, the <em>Communication</em>, or <em>Telegraph</em>, <em>Units</em> are
provided by the Engineers, and the other Administrative
Services are regulated by officials called
“Intendants,” who are attached to Divisional and
Army Corps Commands, and have entire responsibility
for <em>Supply</em>, <em>Remounts</em>, <em>Stores</em>, and <em>Finance</em>.
As to <em>Transport</em>, each Army Corps has a “Train
Battalion,” a combatant Unit which provides the
Infantry, Cavalry, Engineer, and Medical Units
(but not those of Artillery) with the wagons,
teams, and drivers they require, and furnishes the
Transport Columns for carrying supplies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
The personnel of the Medical Services is similarly
furnished by the “Army Corps Medical organization,”
and the Principal Medical Officers on the
Staff of Divisions and Corps administer the
Medical Services.</p>

<p>A Director of Medical Services, an Intendant-General,
and a Judge-Advocate-General are attached
to “General,” as well as to “Army,”
Head-Quarters.</p>

<p>As regards the other Services, the <em>Veterinary</em>
and <em>Postal Services</em>, and the <em>Chaplains</em>, do not
generally form part of any higher Staffs than those
of Divisions.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the system is so designed
that in the main the business of Administration in
detail falls on the Divisional and Army Corps
Commands, while the Army Command is left
free to concentrate its attention on the enemy.</p>

<p>The principles on which the Administration
of an Army in the Field is organized for war as
carried on at the present day, can be best understood
by a study of the British Administrative
Services. The general lines of their organization
will be found described in Chapters <a href="#CHAPTER_IX">IX</a>. and <a href="#CHAPTER_X">X</a>.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE STAFF</span></h2>
</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Head-Quarters</span></h3>

<p>Each of the various formations of Troops just
described is completed by appointing its Commander
and providing him with a <dfn>Staff</dfn>—that is, a body of
Staff Officers to assist him in the duties of Command.
The Commander and his Staff form what
is known as the <em>Head-Quarters</em> of every Command.
Those of the Commander-in-Chief are termed
<em>General Head-Quarters</em>, those of an Army Commander
<em>Army Head-Quarters</em>, and so on, down to
<em>Brigade Head-Quarters</em>.</p>

<h4 id="hdr_32">COMPOSITION OF HEAD-QUARTERS</h4>

<p>Head-Quarters consist essentially of the <em>Commander</em>
with his <em>Personal Staff</em>, and of the Staff
Officers constituting the <em>Staff</em> proper, which it is
the object of this chapter to describe in detail.</p>

<p>The Personal Staff needs little remark. It
comprises the officers acting as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Aides de Camp</i>
to the Commander, and in important Head-Quarters
there is also a <em>Military Secretary</em>. These
officers act as confidential secretaries to their Chief,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
carry his Orders, manage his household, and arrange
for its movements. Their relations with their Chief
are more personal than official, and they are not
considered to be Staff Officers.</p>

<p>Besides the Staff, there are generally attached
to Head-Quarters a number of other Officers, such
as those of Administrative Services, and in some
armies Officers of Artillery or Engineers. But
these cannot be properly called Staff Officers, as
they have only a limited sphere of action in the
Command, while they perform definite executive
and administrative functions in their own sphere.
The action of <dfn>Staff Officers</dfn>, on the contrary,
ranges over the whole Command, but they have
no personal responsibility or executive functions.
In fact they are useful appendages to each link
of the chain of Command, but not actually links
in it themselves.</p>

<p>In addition to <em>Officers</em>, there are always connected
with Head-Quarters a number of subordinates,
such as interpreters, clerks, police, printers,
lithographers, telegraphists, signallers, cyclists,
motor-car drivers, orderlies, and postal employees,
as well as grooms, servants, cooks, and drivers for
the wagons which transport the offices and baggage
of the Head-Quarters.</p>

<p>Head-Quarters are therefore so large as to
form virtually a Unit in themselves. This Unit
requires a <dfn>Commandant</dfn>, or Officer responsible for
its movement, quartering, and discipline, with
perhaps a Quarter-Master-Sergeant to assist him.
There would generally be with each Head-Quarters
a small body of Military Police to maintain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
discipline, and Medical and Veterinary Officers
to take charge of the health of the officers, men,
and horses at Head-Quarters. The safety of Head-Quarters
is so important that they must be provided
also with Infantry to guard them, and Cavalry
to form their escort when in rapid movement.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Varieties of Staff</span></h3>

<p>The number and description of Staff Officers
allotted to a Command depend on its importance,
and on the duties they have to perform.</p>

<p>The duty of the Staff Officer is defined as follows
in British Field Service Regulations: “To assist
the Commander in the supervision and control
of the operations and requirements of the Troops,
to transmit his Orders, and to assist the Troops in
carrying them out.” In the British Service these
duties are divided among three Branches of the
Staff—the <em>General Staff</em>, the <em>Adjutant-General’s
Branch</em>, and that of the <em>Quarter-Master-General</em>.</p>

<p>The Staff has in foreign armies become differentiated
into two Branches—the <em>Routine Staff</em>, which
the Germans style <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Adjutantur</i>; and the <dfn>General
Staff</dfn>, which assists the Commander in all matters
directly affecting the fighting. The Prussian
General Staff is nearly a century old, and forms
in general features a model of the General Staff
more recently instituted in other armies. Its
development from the Quarter-Master-General’s
Staff is sketched in the historical part of this work.</p>

<p>A short analysis of the main duties devolving on
these different branches of the Staff will now be
given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<h4 id="hdr_33">THE GENERAL STAFF</h4>

<p>The purpose of the Commander is to defeat
his enemy, and in endeavouring to effect this
object he has two main pre-occupations:</p>

<p>1. To watch the movements and forecast the
plans of the enemy.</p>

<p>2. To make his own plans, and to decide on
the movements and distribution of his forces
required to carry them out.</p>

<p>In order that the Commander may devote his
whole attention to these vital matters, he should
be as far as possible relieved from details, and these
fall within the province of his General Staff.</p>

<p>We thus see that the main duties of the General
Staff should correspond to those laid down for the
General, and may be summed up under the following
heads:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>1. <em>Intelligence</em>, to enable the Commander to
watch the enemy’s movements, and make
his plans.</p>

<p>2. <em>Operations</em>, by which his plans are carried
out.</p></blockquote>

<p>Each of these headings comprises an immense
amount of detailed work, which cannot be here
dwelt on further than to indicate its general scope.</p>

<blockquote class="hang2">
<p>1. <dfn>Intelligence</dfn> means collecting information
about the enemy and the theatre of war,
from every possible source, and arranging
for its transmission to Head-Quarters, to be
examined and collated, and then laid before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
the Commander. This subject also includes
everything connected with maps and topographical
information, as well as Press
Censorship, and provision of interpreters
and guides.</p>

<p>2. <dfn>Operations</dfn> include:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Working out details of dispositions
and movements of troops, as to their <em>units</em>
and <em>numbers</em>, with especial attention to
<em>place</em> and <em>time</em>, and attention to the security
of the troops in movement and at rest.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Embodying the Commander’s plans in
clear and concise “Operation Orders.”</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Transmitting these Orders with certainty
and despatch.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Watching, and ensuring, their due
execution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The services of <dfn>Inter-communication</dfn> must be
carried on under the control of the General Staff,
so as to ensure the rapid transmission of Information
to, and Orders from, Head-Quarters.</p>

<p>But in addition to the above responsibilities
which fall on the General Staff, there are also Staff
duties involved in assisting the Commander to keep
his Command in a state of efficiency, which depends
on the following requirements:</p>

<p>First, that its organization, discipline, health,
and numbers be kept up.</p>

<p>Secondly, that its material wants be met.</p>

<p>These duties do not bear directly on the fighting,
and so do not fall to the General Staff, but to the
other branches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<h4 id="hdr_34">THE ADJUTANT-GENERAL’S BRANCH (A.G.)</h4>

<p>Duties under the first heading are undertaken
by the Staff of the <dfn>Adjutant-General</dfn>, which deals
with the following matters affecting the personnel
of the Command: discipline, law, and police; pay,
interior economy, and routine Orders; casualties
and returns; appointments, promotions, and
rewards; reinforcements, and organization of improvised
units and local levies; the disposal of
prisoners; collecting the wounded and burying the
dead. All possible office work in connection with
these matters should be done at the Base, so as not
to burden the Troops in the Field with clerical
work carried on under difficulties.</p>

<p>Since the Adjutant-General’s Branch is responsible
for the <em>health</em> of the Force, the Medical
Services are placed under its control in the British
Service. In foreign armies they are administered
by their own Heads at Head-Quarters of Divisions
and Army Corps, under the control of the General
Staff.</p>

<h4 id="hdr_35">THE QUARTER-MASTER-GENERAL’S BRANCH (Q.M.G.)</h4>

<p>The second heading (supplying the material
wants of the Army) comprises, besides the duties
of the Medical Services mentioned above, those of
the Supply, Store, Transport, and other Administrative
Services. The work of the latter is
carried out in detail by the Heads of those Services,
who are under the control of the <dfn>Quarter-Master-General’s</dfn>
Staff in the British Service. In foreign
armies, where there is no Q.M.G.’s Staff, they are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
under a Civilian Official called the <dfn>Intendant</dfn>, who
works under the control of the General Staff in
each Command.</p>

<p>The British Staff Organization, which concentrates
these Administrative Services under the
Q.M.G., is no doubt a better arrangement. It
relieves the General Staff of pre-occupation regarding
their working, and minimizes any failure of
adjustment between the Field Units and the
Services on the Lines of Communication, by
charging a special Branch of the Staff with their
co-ordination.</p>

<h4 id="hdr_36">STAFF OF SUBORDINATE COMMANDS</h4>

<p>The above description of Staff work refers in its
entirety only to General, or Army, Head-Quarters,
but a similar organization of Staff is applicable on
a smaller scale to Head-Quarters of Subordinate
Commands. In small Head-Quarters the same
Staff Officer may have to undertake more than one
set of duties.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_37"><span class="smcap">Importance of the Staff</span></h3>

<p>The importance to the Army of a competent
Staff can be judged from the above account of
their duties. The Staff forms the nervous system
of the Command. The better trained the Staff,
the more free will the General be to concentrate
his attention on the situation, and his Subordinate
Commanders to carry out his plans with co-operating
intelligence. Good Staff Officers, it has been
well said, are eyes, ears, and hands to their Chief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_38"><span class="smcap">Number of Officers Allotted to the Staff</span></h3>

<p>In organizing the Staff of any Command it is
desirable to keep the number of Officers at a
minimum, as not only does every appointment to
the Staff weaken some fighting unit, but a better
selection is possible if there are only a few appointments
to fill. There will be also less difficulty in
finding accommodation in the field for a small
Head-Quarters, and less delay or confusion in
moving it. It should not be forgotten, too, that
there will not always be enough work for a large
Staff to do, and that, when men are not fully
occupied, mischief and friction are apt to arise.</p>

<span class="subhead">WAR ESTABLISHMENTS</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 id="hdr_39"><span class="smcap">Their Object and Utility</span></h3>

<p>The previous chapters, describing the Units of the
various Arms, and their grouping into the larger
Formations, give only the broad lines of the organization
of the Army. The detailed composition
or <dfn>Establishment</dfn> of each Unit is shown in a table
giving the numbers of Officers and Non-Commissioned
Officers by their ranks, of men according
to their various functions, and of horses—riding,
draught, and pack. These numbers make up what
is termed the <em>Strength</em> of the Unit. Similarly,
there are laid down Establishments for the larger
Formations, which are given in tables showing the
Head-Quarters, the numbers of Units of fighting
troops and the Administrative Services, and the
total numbers of personnel and animals, according
to their various categories.</p>

<p>It is convenient to add to these Establishments
a statement of the <dfn>Transport</dfn> of each Unit or
Formation, showing the guns, wagons, and carts,
of all descriptions, with the drivers and animals
required.</p>

<p>The Strength given in Establishments represents<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
the total numbers of men and animals drawing
rations daily in the field, and may be termed the
<dfn>Ration Strength</dfn>. It is often summed up as so
many “officers” and “other ranks” (or so many of
“all ranks”) and horses. The <dfn>Fighting Strength</dfn>
means the number of men actually available for
fighting, and the number of guns horsed and
manned. The Fighting Strength is generally
reckoned as so many <dfn>rifles</dfn>, or men fighting on
foot, so many <dfn>sabres</dfn>, or mounted fighting men,
and so many <em>guns</em>. The number of men with the
guns is not included in the fighting strength, nor
are officers, Staff Sergeants, or Drivers. But all
Cavalry officers, even the Commanders and Staff,
might strictly be counted as “sabres,” as they
actually fight with the same arm as the men, which
Infantry officers do not.</p>

<p>It will be observed that in the larger Formations
there is a great discrepancy between the <em>Total
Strength</em> and the <em>Fighting Strength</em>. This is due
to the numbers of men employed for non-combatant
functions, or in the auxiliary services, and of horses
required for transport. Thus, in a German Army
Corps the total strength is 41,000 men, 14,000
horses, and 2,400 vehicles; while the fighting
strength is 25,000 rifles, 1,200 sabres, and 126 guns.
In the British Cavalry Division the total strength
is nearly 10,000 men and horses, and 550 vehicles;
while the fighting strength is under 6,000 sabres,
with 24 machine guns and 24 guns.</p>

<p>Tables of War Establishments furnish a complete
statement of the Organization for war. On
them are founded the necessary calculations for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
mobilizing the peace army, for its transport by sea
or rail to the theatre of war, and for its supply with
food, ammunition, clothing, and stores.</p>

<p>The <dfn>mobilization</dfn> of a Unit for war may be
defined as providing it with the men and animals
required to complete its War Establishment, and
with its <dfn>War Outfit</dfn>, or the matériel of all kinds
with which it has to be furnished for War. This
War Outfit is in the British Service considered
under the following heads:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>(<i>a</i>) The <dfn>Personal Kit</dfn> of each soldier—that is,
his <em>clothing</em> and small <em>necessaries</em>.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <dfn>War Equipment</dfn>, which is <em>personal</em> or <em>regimental</em>.</p>

<p class="nohang"><dfn>Personal Equipment</dfn> comprises the Arms
and Ammunition carried, and the Accoutrements
worn, by each soldier.</p>

<p class="nohang"><dfn>Regimental Equipment</dfn> comprises guns,
reserve of ammunition, vehicles, harness,
saddlery, stationery, butchery and cooking
utensils.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <dfn>Regimental Supplies</dfn> of food and forage.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The <em>Medical and Veterinary Equipment</em>
allotted to the Unit.</p></blockquote>

<p>These Establishments are laid down for the
most important, or the most likely, wars which
the nation may have to wage. They represent the
normal requirements, which are those of a campaign
in a civilized country, and in a temperate
climate. The tables would be altered in the case
of war under other conditions, such as in hot or
cold climates or seasons, in mountain warfare, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
fighting savages, in quelling civil insurrection, or
when a force is designed for special and limited
operations, such as a raid, or the capture of an
oversea fortress.</p>

<p>Instances of such improvised organization may
be found in most British campaigns of the past two
centuries, and of late years in the Expeditionary
Forces sent by France to Madagascar, by the
United States to Cuba, and by Germany to South-West
Africa.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_40"><span class="smcap">States and Returns</span></h3>

<p>War Establishments by no means represent the
real strength during a war. It may happen that the
Army engages in the war without its war establishment
being completed. But even if each unit
were at its correct war establishment when entering
on the campaign, this will not long represent
its actual strength. Sick and stragglers waste the
ranks daily. After fighting, the missing, wounded,
and dead have to be deducted. From time to
time reinforcements are added in irregular numbers.</p>

<p>Besides the wastage of units, the whole force at
the front is apt to become reduced by detachments
being taken to guard communications, to escort
prisoners or convoys, to garrison fortresses, or to
undertake sieges. Napoleon considered that out of
every 8 men in an army, only 5 could be counted
on as available for the decisive battle of the war.</p>

<p>It is, however, essential for every Commander to
be kept informed of the state of his Command for
fighting purposes, which the Establishments do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
not show. This information is supplied by every
Commanding Officer of a Unit in a document
called a <em>State</em>, rendered, as a rule, daily. The <dfn>State</dfn>
shows the fighting condition of the unit, its strength
in officers, men, horses, and guns, the amount of
ammunition in hand, as well as any other points
affecting its fighting efficiency. A State may be
rendered by telegraph, or even verbally, to ensure
its prompt arrival.</p>

<p><dfn>Returns</dfn> of strength are also made by every
Commanding Officer. These differ from <em>States</em> in
being rendered at longer intervals, so that they can
be more deliberately and accurately made out.
They are used for purposes of record and accounting.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_41"><span class="smcap">Reinforcements</span></h3>

<p>The importance of keeping up the effective
strength of the Army cannot be exaggerated.
Drafts of reinforcements should be prepared at the
outset, and the supply continuously maintained.
There is no principle of organization more clear
than the necessity of keeping the existing units up
to strength, and not reinforcing with new units,
even if the numbers added to the Army be the same
in both cases. New units are not so efficient as
the weak old ones reinforced by fresh men.
They will soon become mere skeletons like the old
units, after which the Army will consist of a great
number of very weak units—a state of things very
detrimental to Command and force of action.</p>

<p>The wastage of war falls mainly on the Infantry,
whose losses in battle and sufferings on the march<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
exceed those of other Arms. Far more losses
are incurred on the march than in the fighting.
Marching is the rule of the soldier’s life in war, fighting
the exception. Infantry wastes away like snow
in the sun, as it marches; footsore men fall out,
and fatigue and privations cause illness. The
statistics of the diminution of the two finest of
the Prussian Corps in 1870 are most striking. The
Third Corps, which fought so well at Spicheren on
the 6th August, and magnificently at Vionville on
the 16th, losing in these battles 350 men per
battalion, dropped 200 per battalion on the road.
The Guards, who entered France with 30,000
Infantry, had only 13,000 rifles after Sedan, a
month later, and 8,000 when they reached Paris,
their loss in battle being only 8,350. The battalions
therefore had lost 300 men on the road, apart from
fighting, during the first six weeks of the war.</p>

<p>In a hard campaign it seems likely, therefore, that
a loss of at least 100 men per battalion per month
must be expected during hard marches, besides
losses in fighting which may amount to more.
Some Prussian Regiments lost from 300 to 500
men per battalion during one day’s fighting in 1870.</p>

<p>The strength of Head-Quarters of Commands,
and of Administrative Services, remains fairly constant
during a campaign, as does the number of guns.
Mounted men waste less than Infantry, as they do
not become footsore, and do not carry the weight
of their equipment, which rests on the horse.</p>

<p>To remedy the wastage of war, the British
organization provides for each Unit proceeding to
the theatre of operations a Reserve, extra to its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Establishment, amounting to 10 per cent. of its
number of rank and file. These men are at first
retained at the Base, so as to be readily available,
and are called the “First Reinforcements.” It is
calculated that subsequent reinforcements, amounting
to some 60 per cent. of the total strength of
the Force, but mainly required for the Infantry,
are likely to be sufficient to replace the wastage of
the first year of a war. For the British Expeditionary
Force of 153,000 in the Field the
strength of First Reinforcements is 14,000 and
that of subsequent Reinforcements will probably
be about 2,700 officers and 75,000 men.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_42"><span class="smcap">Evils of Improvised Organizations</span></h3>

<p>It might be considered that the larger formations
of all Arms need not be permanently
organized, but might be improvised for War.
This was formerly the system in all armies, and
persisted in the British Service until a few years
ago; while in the United States there is even now
no higher unit than the Regiment. But improvised
bodies of troops are not so efficient as
permanent formations. This could be shown by
many examples from history. The force defeated
at Majuba was formed of Companies of several
Regiments, and in 1870 the working of the German
Cavalry Divisions, which were formed only on
mobilization, left much to be desired.</p>

<p>There are several advantages in assembling troops,
in permanent Commands. In the first place, the
training together of all Arms, and of their various
units, creates confidence throughout the force.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
It can be easily seen how they will learn to know
each other’s methods of action, and to rely on
their mutual co-operation. For instance, it has
been found how much better Artillery supports the
other troops of its own Division, whom it has been
accustomed to work with.</p>

<p>In the second place, where Staff Officers work
constantly together, and understand each other,
their work will be better and more rapidly done.
Also, when troops are accustomed to work with
the same Staff, Orders can be short and concise,
and therefore more quickly drafted, and better
understood. All this saves time, and much
increases the mobility on which depends success
in manœuvring.</p>

<p>In the third place, it is most desirable that the
Chief should know his Staff and still more his
Subordinate Commanders. He will thus be able
to apportion to each officer a task suited to his
qualifications. This tends to efficiency in Command.</p>

<p>The Administration, too, of improvised units
always leaves much to be desired. The Administrative
Services of each portion may be permanent
and adequate, but additional ones will be required
for the new Unit, as well as improvised Head-Quarters.
MacMahon’s failure at Wörth was partly
due to his having to command a detached Army
with only the Staff of his own Army Corps.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_43"><span class="smcap">Importance of Preserving Original
Organization</span></h3>

<p>The organization of a force regulates the
conditions of its command and administration, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
should be altered during the war only if it be
absolutely necessary to do so. Any alteration
interrupts the accustomed channel for Orders,
necessitates changes in Commanders and Staff, and
disorganizes the system of Supply. An improvised
unit, it has already been shown, is never so efficient
as a permanent one, and to form one will rob some
existing units to provide the new Commander and
Staff. Change in organization, therefore, makes
control less effective, and tends to confusion in
administration, and to general diminution of
efficiency in the Force.</p>

<p>At the same time, the original organization must
not be regarded as immutable, if the Commander-in-Chief
considers it necessary to alter it. This is
definitely laid down in Field Service Regulations,
Part ii., sect. 8, pars. 6 to 10. A redistribution
may become imperative for reasons of Strategy or
Command, but fewer occasions for this necessity
will arise if the original organization has been well
thought out, so as to meet all requirements which
can be foreseen. In the South African War the
organization by Army Corps was given up at the
beginning, and has never been revived. But in
this connection it may be submitted that the
frequent formation of improvised sub-commands
for special purposes was responsible for loss of force
in their leading, which sometimes entailed failure,
as in the case of De Wet’s escape.</p>

<p>It is a rule that units should, if possible, be kept
intact when forming detachments like Advanced
Guards, or those for special operations, which
should not be formed out of fragments of several<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
units, like the force defeated at Majuba Hill
in 1881.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_44"><span class="smcap">The Ordre de Bataille</span></h3>

<p>In planning the movements of a force it is
desirable to keep the Sub-Commands in the same
relative position throughout. Thus, a corps originally
on the right of another should not get to the
left of it, nor one in rear pass another in front
of it. This will avoid useless marching and
delays, and confusion in the trains in rear.</p>

<p>This may be summed up as the principle of
maintaining the original <dfn xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ordre de Bataille</dfn>. This
expression, which originally meant the “battle
array,” or order in which the Army was drawn up
for battle, is sometimes used to denote the
strategical array, or the composition and distribution
of the various formations which make
up the Army. The <em>Ordre de Bataille</em> has no
longer any reference to their relative positions on
the battle ground, which necessarily change with
the circumstances of each engagement. But this
document is still indispensable for an army. No
Orders can be drafted except by referring to it,
and without it the direction and control of an
army would be impossible. A knowledge of the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ordre de Bataille</i> of the enemy—that is, of the
composition and distribution of the Subordinate
Commands of his army—is obviously of the first
importance in planning movements and combinations
against him. It can generally be arrived
at from a study of his peace organization and
his railway facilities for concentration, corrected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
by any information procurable as to the position
of his troops. This information may come from
various sources, such as newspaper reports of
the progress of his concentration, captured documents
and letters, deserters, and spies. After an
action, the insignia on the uniforms of dead,
wounded, and prisoners, the lettering of captured
guns, wagons, and baggage, give valuable hints as
to the units engaged. It is open to question
whether such information might not be withheld
from the enemy.</p>

<p id="hdr_45">In the Manchurian War the Japanese carefully
avoided helping the enemy by indicating units on
uniforms, and instructed their men, when wounded
or captured, to refrain from stating their Corps.
They increased the strength of their Divisions,
altered the number of Divisions composing each
Army, and even formed an additional Army out of
time-expired reserves, without the facts leaking
out. This greatly hindered the Russians from
estimating the Japanese strength in the different
sections of the great battles.</p>

<p>Napoleon made a practice of allotting larger
numbers to the Army Corps and Divisions commanded
by his best Generals, and this irregularity
was increased by his constantly raising additional
battalions and squadrons to meet special exigencies,
and by incorporating foreign contingents
in his armies. The result was, the French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ordre
de Bataille</i> was so irregular as to make any <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i>
calculation of strength on the part of his enemies
of doubtful value.</p>

<p id="hdr_46">The difficulty consequently found by the historian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
in calculating the strengths, and following
the movements, of the French Armies in the
Napoleonic Wars is a measure of that which his
enemy’s Staff must have met in arriving at a
definite idea of the strength and disposition of the
French Forces at any given moment.</p>

<p>It is plain that the modern aim of making
organization so logical and methodical that the
Staff can more easily plan operations, and write
correct Orders, had little weight with Napoleon.
He was himself his own Chief of the General
Staff, and had a memory which no complexity
could confuse. It may be a question whether
modern symmetry of organization may not be
really injurious to success, because highly informing
to the enemy. Simplicity and symmetry are
obviously useful in saving difficulties to the Staff;
but this advantage may be bought too dearly, and
a complicated and illogical organization might be
the best for war, so as to prevent the enemy
acquiring information.</p>

<p>The British Troops organized for service in the
field consist of the <dfn>Expeditionary Force</dfn>, formed by
the Regular Army and its Reserves, and the
<dfn>Territorial Force</dfn>, composed of troops which are
virtually Militia, undergoing only a slight annual
training, and engaged in their civil avocations
during the rest of the year. To these may be
added the regular troops in the Mediterranean
(Gibraltar, Malta, and Egypt), and in South
Africa, from which a Division may be formed
to add to the Expeditionary Force. The forces
of the self-governing Dominions need not be
considered. They are hardly as yet organized
as Field Armies, and are kept up for Local
Defence. There is also the <dfn>Indian Army</dfn>, composed
of regular troops, British and Indian.</p>

<p>The <dfn>Expeditionary Force</dfn> corresponds to what
in foreign countries is termed the Army of <em>First</em>
Line, and the <dfn>Territorial Force</dfn> to the Army of
<em>Second</em> Line; the former being intended for action
against our enemies abroad, and the latter for
Home Defence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_47"><span class="smcap">The Expeditionary Force</span></h3>

<p>The <dfn>Expeditionary Force</dfn> comprises essentially
the following bodies of Troops:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>One <em>Cavalry Division</em>, as Independent Cavalry.</p>

<p>Two <em>Mounted Brigades</em>, as Army Protective
Cavalry.</p>

<p>Six <em>Infantry Divisions</em>, to which may eventually
be added a seventh from the Mediterranean
and South Africa.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Force will be provided with a <em>General Head-Quarters</em>,
and with an <em>Army Head-Quarters</em> if it
is proposed to divide it into two Armies.</p>

<p>There will also be allotted to the Force certain
Units under the immediate command of the
Commander-in-Chief, termed “Army Troops.”
Some of these Units will also be allotted to any
separate Armies which may be formed.</p>

<p>Units of Troops will also be provided for duties
on the Lines of Communication. These will consist
of the “L. of C. Defence Troops,” and of the
Head-Quarters and Administrative Services on the
Lines of Communication.</p>

<p>The composition of the various Head-Quarters,
and the number and nature of the Units of Army
Troops, and of the Units on the L. of C., will
depend on the conditions of the campaign, which
will vary according to the enemy to be encountered,
the climate and nature of the theatre of
war, and the character of the Lines of Operations
and Communications.</p>

<p>It was explained in the previous chapter that in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
order to allow of normal Establishments to be
drawn up, the assumption is made that the war
will take place in a civilized country and in a
temperate climate. A <em>normal</em> Line of Communications
is also assumed, consisting of a Seaport or a
Base, a railway from it 100 miles long, and two
lines of road 30 miles long from Railhead to the
Advanced Bases.</p>

<p>The following pages show the composition of
the whole Force and of the various Subordinate
Commands forming it, as well as that of the
various Head-Quarters, the “Army Troops,” and
the Troops on the Lines of Communication. The
Establishments of the various Fighting Units are
also given, followed by a table of their strength in
round numbers of officers, men, and horses actually
belonging to the Unit.</p>

<p>Some notes on the general principles on which
the Establishments have been drawn up will first
be given.</p>

<p>A <em>Medical Officer</em> is attached to each unit, and
a <em>Veterinary Officer</em> to each mounted unit.</p>

<p>Two to five men of the <em>Medical Corps</em> are
attached to each unit, according to its strength.</p>

<p>A <dfn>Bâtman</dfn>—that is, an officer’s servant or groom—is
provided for each Officer, and a second one if
he has more than one horse. Bâtmen are armed
and trained soldiers, taken from the unit, and
available for duty in its ranks.</p>

<p><em>Draught Horses</em> are allotted as follows: six to
each gun or ammunition-wagon, four to each
wagon, and two to each cart. Spare horses are
provided at the rate of 10 per cent. of the total.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
One <em>Driver</em> is provided for each pair, and
10 per cent. of <em>spare drivers</em> are added, but this
number is 5 per cent. in the case of Divisional
Ammunition Columns, and T. and S. Parks.</p>

<p>Two <em>Trumpeters</em>, <em>Drummers</em>, or <em>Buglers</em>, are
allotted to each Squadron or Company of Fighting
Troops.</p>

<p>The <dfn>Regimental Sergeant-Major</dfn> is a Warrant
Officer. There is one in each Cavalry Regiment,
Infantry Battalion, and Artillery Brigade.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE EXPEDITIONARY FORCE (<i>continued</i>)</span>

<span class="subhead">ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>A description will now be given of the organization
of the British Administrative Services designed
for the Expeditionary Force of six Divisions with
a Cavalry Division and two Mounted Brigades.</p>

<p id="hdr_52">At the head of each Administrative Service is a
<dfn>Director</dfn>, who is the adviser of the C.-in-C. on
technical matters connected with the Service he
administers. He is responsible for providing for
the requirements which his Service is designed to
meet, subject to the instructions of that branch of
the Staff to which the C.-in-C. has delegated his
authority in this respect.</p>

<p>A representative of each Director is allotted to
the Staff of the L. of C. and of the Subordinate
Commands, to whom he holds the same position
as his Director does to the Staff of the C.-in-C.
The Services are thus kept in close touch with the
Staff, so as to conform readily to the movements
and requirements of the Troops.</p>

<p>The following is a list of the Directors, and
shows the nature of the duty of the Administrative
Service which each directs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
Director of Army Signals: Service of inter-communication.</p>

<p>Director of Army Medical Services: Care of
the sick and wounded; sanitation.</p>

<p>Director of Army Transport: Provision of
transport.</p>

<p>Director of Army Supplies: Provision of food,
forage, fuel, and light.</p>

<p>Director of Army Ordnance Services: Provision
of ammunition, equipment, clothing, and
stores.</p>

<p>Director of Army Veterinary Service: Care of
animals.</p>

<p>Director of Army Remounts: Providing fresh
horses.</p>

<p>Director of Army Railways: Working of railways.</p>

<p>Director of Army Works: Engineer works on
the L. of C.</p>

<p>Director of Army Postal Services.</p>

<p>The Service of Army Signals is controlled by
the General Staff, and the Medical Services by the
Adjutant-General’s Branch, for the reasons previously
explained, in describing the organization of
the Staff, in <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">Chapter VI.</a> All the other Directors,
and their representatives with Subordinate Commands,
work under the supervision of the Quarter-Master-General’s
Branch of the Staff.</p>

<p>Besides the above Directors, and the Administrative
Services they control, the following Officials
and Departments form part of the General Head-Quarters
of the Army in the Field.</p>

<p>A <dfn>Deputy Judge-Advocate-General</dfn>, for legal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
advice, and a <em>Principal Chaplain</em> are attached to
Head-Quarters of the C.-in-C., and are placed
under the Adjutant-General.</p>

<p>An <em>Accounts Department</em>, under the Financial
Adviser attached to Head-Quarters, and a <dfn>Record
Office</dfn>, to deal with correspondence, will be established
at the Base.</p>

<p>Of the officers enumerated above, the first four
Directors, those of Army Signals, Medical Services,
Transport, and Supplies, accompany General Head-Quarters
in the field. The remainder are usually
attached to the Head-Quarters of the Lines of
Communication, where the Services they administer
are mainly employed.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_53"><span class="smcap">Organization of the Lines Of
Communication</span></h3>

<p>It is desirable, therefore, that a sketch of the
organization of the Administrative Services should
be prefaced by one of that of the Lines of Communication
(L. of C.), on which they mainly act.
The normal L. of C. for which these Services are
calculated is a Railway 100 miles long reaching
from a Sea Base to Railhead, and thence by two
roads 30 miles long to two Advanced Bases.</p>

<p>The <em>defence</em> of the L. of C. is now entirely
separated from its <em>administration</em>, and is entrusted
to an Officer styled the <dfn>Commander of L. of C.
Defences</dfn>, who is also responsible for its military
government when in hostile territory. To this
officer are allotted certain “L. of C. Defence
Troops” (two battalions for the normal L. of C.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
laid down). The L. of C. is divided into sections
for defence, each under a subordinate “L. of C.
Defence Commander.”</p>

<p>The <em>administration</em> of the L. of C. is vested in
an Officer styled the <dfn>Inspector-General of Communications</dfn>,
who has command over all the Administrative
Services on the L. of C., controls their
working, and regulates the traffic on the L. of C.
He has a Staff, to which are attached the Heads of
the Administrative Services, or their representatives.
The L. of C. consists essentially of one
or more <em>Advanced Bases</em> close in rear of the Army,
a <dfn>Railhead</dfn> (beyond which railway service is not
organized), various intermediate <em>Sections</em>, or <em>Posts</em>,
as required, and, most important of all, the <em>Base</em>,
at the end farthest from the front, and nearest
home. The sections may be conterminous with
the sections of defence. For each of these portions
of the L. of C. there is an Administrative
Commandant in charge of its interior economy,
and responsible for forwarding the traffic on the
L. of C. through his section.</p>

<p id="hdr_54">Each of the Administrative Services will now
be discussed in detail; those which are in part with
the Fighting Troops at the front being described
in this chapter, those which are entirely on the
L. of C. in the next.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_55">1. <span class="smcap">Service of Inter-communication</span></h3>

<p>It is only in the armies of England and the
United States that a complete system of inter-communication
between all parts of the Army has
been organized. Such a system has not been fully
developed in foreign armies, but its necessity is
more than ever pressing, owing to the wide dispersion
of forces in war, and the need for rapid
transmission of <em>Information</em> as to the enemy’s
movements from the Front to Head-Quarters, and
of <em>Orders</em> from the several Head-Quarters to the
Troops.</p>

<p>The means of communication in war are:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p><dfn>Electric</dfn>: <i>i.e.</i> Telegraph, telephone, wireless.</p>

<p><dfn>Visual</dfn>: <i>i.e.</i> Flag, lamp, or heliograph.</p>

<p><dfn>Manual</dfn>: <i>i.e.</i> Orderlies (mounted, bicycle, or
foot); a system of relay posts served by
despatch riders; motor cars or motor
cycles.</p>

<p><em>Balloons, aeroplanes, and kites</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Balloons were first used by the French at the
Battle of Fleurus in 1794, and are being experimented
on by many nations at present. There
will be six balloons, of which three can be worked
at one time, with the British Army of six Divisions,
and probably two balloons to each German Army
Corps.</p>

<p>The whole system of inter-communication in the
British Expeditionary Force is under the <em>Director
of Army Signals</em>, who is at General Head-Quarters,
in close connection with the General Staff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
Communication Units are provided for General
Head-Quarters and Divisions, and also on the
L. of C., as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>Cavalry Division: 1 Wireless Telegraph Company.</p>

<p>Infantry Division: 1 Telegraph Company.</p>

<p>General Head-Quarters: 2 Cable Telegraph
Companies; 2 Air-line Companies; 3 Balloon
Companies.</p>

<p>Lines of Communication: 2 Telegraph Companies.</p></blockquote>

<p>The following are the details of the communication
provided by these units, and of their composition:</p>

<h4>WIRELESS TELEGRAPH COMPANY</h4>

<p>The <dfn>Wireless Telegraph Company</dfn> provides communication
between General Head-Quarters and
the Cavalry Division, up to 80 miles, and also
inter-communication in the Cavalry Division, between
Head-Quarters and the Brigades, up to
20 miles.</p>

<p>The Company is composed as follows: A Head-Quarters
Section, for communication with General
Head-Quarters, and with detached Brigades; three
Sections for three detached Brigades (the fourth
Brigade being with Divisional Head-Quarters). Each
of these Sections carries its wireless equipment in
a wagon, but is also provided with 3 pack horses
to carry it. The Head-Quarters Section has equipment
for 5 large stations—one for communication
with the three Sections, two detached to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
General Head-Quarters, and two for communicating
with the latter. These duplicate stations allow
of one pair being ready for work while the other
pair are moving into new positions as the Head-Quarters
advance.</p>

<p>The strength of the Company is 136, with 114
horses—namely: 5 Officers, 6 Sergeants, 4 Artificers,
1 Trumpeter, 120 rank and file, of whom 60 are
available for the telegraph work.</p>

<p>There are 16 wagons, 46 riding horses, and 4
bicycles.</p>

<h4>DIVISIONAL TELEGRAPH COMPANY</h4>

<p>The Divisional Telegraph Company provides for
internal communication in the Division. It comprises
3 Detachments, each providing a line of
cable 10 miles long, with 3 telegraph offices for
communication with the 3 Brigades.</p>

<p>The strength of the Company is 61, with 41
horses—namely: 2 Officers, 3 Sergeants, 1 Artificer,
55 rank and file, of whom 35 are available for
the telegraph work.</p>

<p>There are 6 wagons, 21 riding horses, and 1
bicycle.</p>

<h4>ARMY TROOPS TELEGRAPH COMPANIES</h4>

<p>There are 2 “Cable Companies” and 2 “Air-line
Companies” at General Head-Quarters. The former
provide temporary communication between General
Head-Quarters and Divisions or Army Detachments;
the latter, communication of a more permanent
character between General Head-Quarters
and the Advanced Base.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
The “Cable Company” comprises a Head-Quarters,
and four Sections, or 9 detachments, each
providing 10 miles of cable line, and 3 telegraph
offices.</p>

<p>The strength of the Company is 176, with 125
horses—namely: 6 Officers, 7 Sergeants, 4 Artificers,
2 Trumpeters, 157 rank and file, of whom 100
are available for the telegraph work.</p>

<p>There are 19 wagons, 61 riding horses, and 1
bicycle.</p>

<p>The “Air-line Company” comprises a Head-Quarters
and three Sections, each of 2 detachments,
providing 20 miles of air-line, 8 miles of
cable, and 6 offices.</p>

<p>The strength of the Company is 225, with 158
horses—namely: 6 Officers, 12 Sergeants, 5 Artificers,
2 Trumpeters, 200 rank and file, of whom
120 are available for the telegraph work.</p>

<p>There are 22 wagons, 52 riding horses, and 1
bicycle.</p>

<h4>BALLOON COMPANIES, FOR RECONNAISSANCE</h4>

<p>Three Balloon Companies are allotted as Army
Troops, each to work one balloon and one set
of kites, with telephones to connect the observer
up in the captive balloon or kite with the ground.</p>

<p>The strength of a Company is 67, with 52
horses—namely: 3 Officers, 3 Sergeants, 1 Artificer,
1 Bugler, 59 rank and file, of whom 30 are
available for the ballooning work.</p>

<p>There are 3 wagons for equipment, 6 reservoir
wagons for gas, 8 riding horses, and 1 bicycle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
<i>Note.</i>—In the strength of all the above Engineer
Units are included 2 men of the Medical Corps
attached.</p>

<p>The above network of telegraphic inter-communication,
extending between all Head-Quarters,
is supplemented within the Units of the Field
Force by a system of <em>Signalling</em>.</p>

<p>Each Division has a Divisional Signalling Officer,
with a small detachment of Signallers—4 men in
the Cavalry Division, and a Sergeant and 6 men
in the Infantry Division.</p>

<p>Each Brigade has a Brigade Signalling Officer
and 4 Signallers.</p>

<p>Each Cavalry Regiment and Mounted Infantry
Battalion has a Signalling Sergeant, with 27
Signallers (9 per squadron).</p>

<p>Each Infantry Regiment has a Signalling Officer
and Sergeant, with 32 Signallers (4 per company).</p>

<p>Each Divisional Artillery Head-Quarters has 4
Signallers.</p>

<p>Every Artillery Brigade has 2 Signallers.</p>

<p>Every Battery has 5 Signallers.</p>

<p>A system of <dfn>Telephones</dfn> is, in addition, provided
for each Infantry Brigade. There is a Telephone
Detachment to work under the Brigade Signalling
Officer. It consists of a N.C.O. and 5 privates,
with a cart and a pack mule to carry the equipment,
for which 2 drivers are allotted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_56">2. <span class="smcap">Transport</span></h3>

<p><dfn>Road Transport</dfn> alone will be here considered.
This is the most important of the Administrative
Services, as on it depend the mobility of the
Force, and the working of the Supply, Medical,
and Stores Services. Transport is required with
the Units at the front, to carry the baggage and
stores of the troops, and their ammunition and
food for daily consumption, and to enable field
ambulances to accompany the army. Transport
is also required on the Lines of Communication,
to bring up ammunition and food from the base to
the front, and to remove the wounded to the base.</p>

<p>It is agreed that Transport must be organized
on a military basis when accompanying troops
at the front, where civil transport is hardly dependable;
but to provide the vast amount required
in rear of the army on the L. of C. would demand
more military Transport than could be kept up in
peace, and <dfn>Auxiliary Transport</dfn> has to be collected
from civil services for this purpose.</p>

<p>It is obvious that without a carefully worked
out system of organization for its Transport, an
army in the field will be helpless from want of
ammunition and food, and slow and uncertain in
its movements; the sick and wounded will lack
attention; and the troops cannot fail to undergo
hardships and privations, which will have a bad
effect on their <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">morale</i> and fighting power.</p>

<p>Owing to the enormous amount of food required
for an army, the main function of the Transport
is to carry <em>supplies</em>, so that the connection between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
Transport and Supply is a very intimate one. It
has been found desirable, therefore, to amalgamate
the administrative units which effect these two
services. Those who are responsible for providing
food should also be responsible for moving it.
The administrative units of the combined services
of Transport and Supply are provided by the
Army Service Corps, as shown in detail in the
next section of this chapter. The Officers of this
Corps are trained both for Transport and Supply
duties. Their identical training and their organization
together in one unit tends to produce co-operation
in both services of Transport and Supply, and
should minimize any chance of failure in war. The
fact that all officers are interchangeable between
these services also gives an elasticity to the system
which is wanting when they are separate.</p>

<h4>REGIMENTAL TRANSPORT</h4>

<p>The Transport with the Units in the field is
called <dfn>Regimental Transport</dfn>, in distinction from
the Transport on the Lines of Communication, and
consists of two categories:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>(<i>a</i>) Transport of Fighting Units, including all
Head-Quarters. This Transport is divided
into <em>First Line</em>, and <em>Second Line</em>, Transport.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Transport of Administrative Units—<i>i.e.</i>
Ambulances, Supply Columns, and Supply
Parks.</p></blockquote>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <dfn>First Line Transport</dfn> forms an integral part
of each fighting unit; the unit provides its own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
drivers and superintendence for its transport, which
accompanies it at all times. The First Line Transport
carries on wheels (or by pack) all that the
unit requires for fighting—namely: guns, ammunition,
entrenching tools—besides signalling, medical,
veterinary, and other technical equipment.</p>

<p><dfn>Second Line Transport</dfn> for all units is provided
by the A.S.C., to carry the baggage, supplies,
stores, and water which the unit requires to have
with it when at rest. This transport is not required
for fighting, and, when near the enemy, does not
accompany its unit, but is all massed in rear of the
fighting troops, but able to rejoin its various units
in a few hours. The water carts alone may at
times accompany the troops.</p>

<p>The stores carried include cooking utensils and
butchers’ implements, artificers’ tools and material,
office books and stationery; also, when specially
required, blankets, tents, and fuel.</p>

<p>The supplies carried are indicated later in the
description of the <dfn>Supply Service</dfn> which follows.</p>

<p>Transport for each Head-Quarters is all furnished
by the Army Service Corps (A.S.C.).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Transport of Administrative Units.—This is
provided also by the A.S.C., and is described in
the two following sections of this chapter, under
the heading of the Supply Services and Medical
Services.</p>

<h4>TRANSPORT ON THE LINES OF COMMUNICATION</h4>

<p>The Transport on the Lines of Communication is
controlled by the representative of the Director of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
Transport at Head-Quarters of the L. of C. It is
carried on by <dfn>Auxiliary Transport Companies</dfn>,
composed generally of non-military wagons, teams,
and drivers, under the control of a small personnel
of Army Service Corps. Mechanical Road Transport
is likely in the future to be very largely
employed on the L. of C. to work from railhead
to the Units of field troops at the front.</p>

<p>In the British Army organization the details of
the L. of C. Transport are as follows:</p>

<p>Twelve Auxiliary Transport Companies of 50
wagons, and six of 100 wagons, are formed. Each
has an A.S.C. personnel of 3 Officers and 54 other
ranks, with 10 riding horses. Every 50 wagons
require 115 drivers and 210 horses, including 5 per
cent. spare.</p>

<p>In case the local transport is formed of carts,
the Auxiliary Company has an A.S.C. personnel
of 1 Officer and 28 other ranks. Every 50 carts
require 58 drivers, and 105 horses, including
spare.</p>

<p>There are four units called <dfn>Transport Depôts</dfn>, each
with a personnel of 3 Officers and 93 other ranks,
organized in four Sections; each Section can form
a small depôt on the L. of C., providing a reserve
of horsed transport to replace wastage, and a
repairing section for mechanical transport.</p>

<p>Transport for local work at the Base, and at
posts on the L. of C., is improvised from civil
sources, as it requires no great degree of mobility,
and, working locally, and at a distance from the
enemy, can be easily kept under supervision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_57">3. <span class="smcap">Supply</span></h3>

<p>Experience teaches that supplies of food can
only be furnished to troops during war in three
ways:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>(<i>a</i>) The men may be fed by the occupants of
the houses where they are billeted.</p>

<p class="nohang">This is only possible in towns, or in
the country when the troops are much
scattered, and when the Army is moving
continuously, and the troops do not remain
more than a day or two in one place.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Food may be obtained from the country by
purchase, or by requisition, which must
always be carried out in a regular manner
by responsible officers, or waste, confusion,
and individual looting and terrorism will
ensue.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Food may be drawn from the L. of C. and
issued by the Supply Service.</p></blockquote>

<p>A combination of all three methods is generally
practicable. The food available in the country
should be used as far as possible, so as to avoid
straining the resources of the Supply Service, and
the capacity of the Lines of Communication.</p>

<p>Under the average conditions of country and
climate for which the British normal regulations
are designed, it may be expected that fuel, water,
hay and straw, and cattle, will be obtainable in the
country. Thus only bread and groceries, and corn
for horses, have normally to be conveyed to the
troops by the Supply Service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
Both purchase and requisition demand good
organization, and trained supply officers accompanying
the troops. The Supply Service is
organized in the way about to be described, partly
so as to provide officers, men, and wagons to collect
supplies in the country and bring them to the
troops, partly to transport from the Base what is
required to supplement the amount collected.</p>

<p>The Supplies for an Army in the Field may be
considered under two heads:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">
<p> (<span class="smcap smaller">I.</span>) <i>Mobile Supplies with the Troops.</i></p>

<p>(<span class="smcap smaller">II.</span>) <i>Supply Depôts on the Lines of Communication.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<h4>(I.) MOBILE SUPPLIES WITH THE TROOPS</h4>

<p>The former are divided into three lines of
supply:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">
<p>(<i>a</i>) Regimental Supplies, controlled by the Unit itself.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Column Supplies.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Park Supplies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last two are controlled by the Supply Service.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <dfn>Regimental Supplies</dfn> are those carried in
Regimental wagons, in addition to what is in the
personal charge of each man—namely, the remains
of the current day’s ration issued overnight, and an
emergency ration of preserved food. In the wagon
with each unit are one day’s ration of food and of
oats for the unit, for issue that evening, besides a
second grocery ration and some compressed forage.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <dfn>Column Supplies</dfn> are carried in Supply
Columns, of which one is allotted to each Division<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
and Mounted Brigade, and to the Army Troops.
Each Column carries one day’s ration and forage
for its Division, and one emergency ration. One
day’s meat on the hoof will usually be driven with
the Column.</p>

<p>The Supply Column replenishes the regimental
supplies daily, and is kept filled up by collecting
local supplies, or by drawing on the L. of C.
depôts, or, as a last resource, on the Park Supplies.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <dfn>Park Supplies</dfn> are carried in the Transport
and Supply Park allotted to each Division, which
usually marches a day’s march in rear of the troops.
It carries three days’ rations for its Division, and is
divided into three sections, <i>i.e.</i> 1 per Brigade.
There is in the Field Park also a Bakery Detachment,
capable of baking for 22,500 men; this is, as
a rule, stationed at the Advanced Base. One to
three days’ meat supply on the hoof will generally
be driven with the Park. The Parks are kept
filled up by a more extended exploitation of local
resources than the Supply Columns can effect, and
obtain the balance required from the L. of C.
depôts.</p>

<p>This organization thus supplies the following
rations per man, and corn per horse, with the
troops in the field, apart from any Supplies which
may be moving up along the L. of C.</p>

<h5>COMPOSITION OF FIELD RATION</h5>

<p>Meat: 1¼ lb. fresh, or 1 lb. preserved.</p>

<p>Bread: 1¼ lb., or 1 lb. biscuit.</p>

<p>Groceries: Tea, sugar, salt, pepper.</p>

<p>Jam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
Lime-juice and rum, when authorized.</p>

<p>Vegetables: 8 oz. fresh, or 2 oz. dried, or 4 oz.
preserved fruit.</p>

<p>The weight of a ration may be taken at 3 lb. net
or 4 lb. gross, and that of the emergency ration is
6½ lb. net or 9½ lb. gross.</p>

<p>The preserved meat and biscuit are carried in
80-lb. wood cases, containing 60 rations of meat
and 50 of biscuit. The cases furnish kindling for
fires.</p>

<p>12 lb. corn per horse, or 15 lb. for heavy
draught horses.</p>

<h5>DISTRIBUTION OF SUPPLIES</h5>

<p>On the man or horse: 1 day’s ration and 1 day’s
oats, less amount consumed overnight; 1 emergency
ration.</p>

<p>In Regimental Transport: 1 day’s ration, less
vegetables, and 1 day’s groceries extra; 1 day’s
corn.</p>

<p>In T. and S. Columns: 1 day’s rations and corn.</p>

<p>In T. and S. Park: 3 days’ rations and corn.</p>

<p>Compressed forage: 1 bale (82 lb.) in each
wagon in the Force.</p>

<p>Total carried with the Force per man and horse:</p>

<p>6 days’ meat and biscuit and corn, less that consumed
overnight;</p>

<p>6 days’ groceries;</p>

<p>5 days’ jam, lime-juice, and rum;</p>

<p>4 days’ vegetables;</p>

<p>2 emergency rations;</p>

<p class="in0">or sufficient for from 7 to 8 days, without receiving
supplies from the L. of C.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<h4>(II.) SUPPLY DEPÔTS ON THE LINES OF
COMMUNICATION</h4>

<p><dfn>Advanced Supply Depôts</dfn>, established at the
Advanced Base, to replenish the Mobile Supplies
with the Troops.</p>

<p><dfn>Intermediate Supply Depôts</dfn>, formed at Railhead,
and sometimes at other points on the Lines of
Communication, as a reserve.</p>

<p>The <dfn>Base Depôt</dfn>.—This is the main source of
supply for the Army. In it are accumulated
ample reserves of all supplies, procured partly from
home, partly by contract from abroad, but as far
as possible by direct purchase in the theatre of war.</p>

<h5>INTERIOR ORGANIZATION OF TRANSPORT AND
SUPPLY UNITS</h5>

<p>The Supply Columns and Supply Parks are
formed by Companies of the “Army Service
Corps,” which comprise both Transport and Supply
personnel, with the necessary horses, wagons, and
stores.</p>

<p>The Company of Army Service Corps varies in
strength according to its functions, but comprises
on an average the following:</p>

<p>For Transport duties: 3 Officers, 63 other ranks,
108 horses, 25 wagons.</p>

<p>For Supply duties: 1 Officer, 13 other ranks.</p>

<p>The various <dfn>Supply Columns</dfn> are formed of a
number of A.S.C. Companies on the following
scale: one Company per Brigade, and one per
Head-Quarters; so that the Supply Column of a
<em>Division</em> comprises 4 A.S.C. Companies, that of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
the <em>Cavalry Division</em> 5 A.S.C. Companies, and
that of a <em>Mounted Brigade</em> 1 A.S.C. Company.
The <em>Army Troops</em> Supply Column is formed by
1 A.S.C. Company.</p>

<p>The <dfn>Divisional Supply Park</dfn> is formed in 3
sections, or one per Brigade, each being formed by
1 A.S.C. Company.</p>

<p>The <dfn>Field Bakery Detachment</dfn> is formed by 1
A.S.C. Company, and is divided into 8 sections,
each of which can erect and work 10 ovens.</p>

<p>The <dfn>Supply Depôts</dfn> on the Lines of Communication
have a personnel provided from 40 <em>Depôt Units
of Supply</em> and 8 <em>Bakery Sections</em>; one unit and
one section are calculated to suffice for a depôt to
feed 4,000 men and 1,000 animals. Their personnel
comprises clerks, issuers, butchers, and bakers.
Civil labour and transport will be obtained to
supplement the military personnel, as required.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_58">4. <span class="smcap">The Medical Services</span></h3>

<p>The Medical Service is of immense importance
to the operations. No General can afford to
neglect his sick and wounded. He can hardly
fight, if he knows he cannot attend to them on
the battlefield, and remove them afterwards to
hospitals in rear. There must be at the front
sufficient surgeons, as well as medical appliances
and stores, to cope with this work. The transport
of the sick to the rear must be carried out
without delay or confusion, and on the Lines of
Communication, and at the Base, there must be
properly equipped hospitals to receive the sick
and wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
The method of dealing with casualties in action
is as follows:</p>

<p>In the front, with the fighting men, are the
regimental surgeons and the stretcher bearers of
the Infantry, for work on the battlefield. Behind
the fighting line are stretcher bearers and ambulance
wagons of the Field Ambulance, collecting
the wounded, and taking them to the dressing
stations. In rear are the Clearing Hospitals,
into which the sick and wounded are collected, and
whence they are despatched in Ambulance Trains
along the railway to Stationary Hospitals on the
Lines of Communication, or to the Base Hospitals.
The invalids are then removed, either to convalescent
depôts on the L. of C., or by hospital ship to
the home country, where civil organization can be
depended on to help the Military Hospitals to deal
with them.</p>

<p>The Medical Services are manned and administered
by the “Royal Army Medical Corps.” Their
transport is provided by the Army Service Corps.
The organization comprises the following:</p>

<h4>(<i>a</i>) WITH THE TROOPS AT THE FRONT</h4>

<p>1. Medical Establishments with Units.</p>

<p>2. Field Ambulances with Subordinate Commands.</p>

<h4>(<i>b</i>) ON THE LINES OF COMMUNICATION</h4>

<p>Six Clearing Hospitals, at Advanced Base.</p>

<p>Six Ambulance Railway Trains, each available
for 100 patients lying down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
Twelve Stationary Hospitals of 200 beds each,
on the Lines of Communication.</p>

<p>Twelve General Hospitals of 520 beds each, at
the Base.</p>

<p>Convalescent Depôts, as required.</p>

<p>Six Hospital Ships, each to carry 220 patients.</p>

<p>Three Base Depôts, and three Advanced Base
Depôts, containing a reserve of Medical Stores.</p>

<p>It will be observed that for a Division and a
Brigade of Mounted Troops there are provided
1 Clearing Hospital, 1 Ambulance Train, 2
Stationary and 2 General Hospitals, and 1
Hospital Ship.</p>

<h4>DETAILS OF MEDICAL ORGANIZATION</h4>

<p>1. Each Unit has attached to it a Medical
Officer, and itself supplies two trained Orderlies,
and a cart (or pack horse for mounted troops), to
carry medical equipment. There are also two
trained stretcher bearers from the ranks of each
Infantry Company (or four men from each Squadron),
trained in “first-aid” duties.</p>

<p>2. <em>Field Ambulances</em> are allotted to each
Division, and <em>Cavalry Field Ambulances</em> to the
Cavalry Division, and to the Mounted Brigades.
They are provided on the scale of one for each
Brigade. There are also two <em>Field Ambulances</em>
for the “Army Troops.”</p>

<p>Each description of Ambulance comprises a
<dfn>Bearer Division</dfn> of stretcher bearers, and a <dfn>Tent
Division</dfn>, which forms a “Dressing Station”—that
is, a small mobile field hospital in which only
absolutely necessary dressing is applied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
The <em>Field Ambulance</em> is divided into three equal
Sections, and the <em>Cavalry Field Ambulance</em> into
two Sections. Each Section has 3 ambulance
wagons, a water cart, and 2 wagons and a cart for
carrying its stores, baggage, and supplies. Each
Section is thus self-contained, and can be sent off
without reorganization, whenever required to accompany
a detached portion of the Brigade.</p>

<p>The strength of a <dfn>Field Ambulance</dfn> is:</p>

<p>10 Officers, 120 stretcher bearers, 60 hospital
staff, all belonging to the Royal Army Medical
Corps (R.A.M.C.), and 60 men and 90 horses
provided by the A.S.C. for its transport, which
consists of 10 four-horsed ambulance wagons, 3
water carts, and 9 other wagons for medical
supplies, baggage, and stores. Its <dfn>Bearer Division</dfn>
provides 18 squads of stretcher bearers, each squad
being of 6 men; and its <dfn>Tent Division</dfn> can accommodate
150 patients.</p>

<p>A <dfn>Cavalry Field Ambulance</dfn> comprises:</p>

<p>6 Officers, 38 stretcher bearers, 30 hospital staff,
of the R.A.M.C., and 44 men and 70 horses of the
A.S.C. It has 4 two-horsed, and 6 four-horsed,
ambulance wagons, 2 water carts, 4 other wagons.
Its <em>Tent Division</em> can accommodate 50 patients.</p>

<p>The establishment of a <dfn>Clearing</dfn>, or a <dfn>Stationary</dfn>,
<em>Hospital</em> to accommodate 200 patients is 8 Officers
and 80 other ranks; that of a <dfn>General Hospital</dfn>, 21
Officers and 140 other ranks. Nursing sisters are
allotted to the non-mobile Hospitals on the
L. of C. at the rate of 17 to 200 patients, but not
to the mobile Clearing Hospitals.</p>

<p>Each Ambulance Train is provided with 2<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
Officers, 18 other ranks, and 2 sisters, and can
carry 100 patients.</p>

<h4>THE SANITARY SERVICE</h4>

<p>The Sanitary Service is one of the Medical
Services. Its object is to preserve the health of the
troops, by looking after purity of water supply,
and sanitation of camps.</p>

<p>The personnel of the Sanitary Service is provided
by the R.A.M.C. It comprises a <em>Sanitary Squad</em>
with each Unit, and on the Lines of Communication
a <em>Sanitary Section</em> at the Base and Railhead,
a Squad at each Post or Rest Camp, and 2 Squads
at each Advanced Base.</p>

<p>The <dfn>Section</dfn> comprises an Officer and 25 men of
the R.A.M.C., the <dfn>Squad</dfn> a Sergeant and 5 men.</p>

<p>In addition, a N.C.O. of each Cavalry Regiment,
or Artillery Brigade, or Battalion, and 1 or 2 men
of each Squadron, Battery, or Company, are
trained for carrying out Sanitary duties with their
Unit.</p>

<span class="subhead">SERVICES ON THE LINES OF COMMUNICATION</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 id="hdr_59">5. <span class="smcap">The Veterinary Service</span></h3>

<p>The efficiency of the Veterinary Service is of
great importance to prevent waste of horseflesh.</p>

<p>This Service is under its Director, who has a
Veterinary Officer to assist him. A Veterinary
Officer is allotted to each Division and to the
L. of C. Each of the above officers has one clerk.
A Veterinary Officer is attached to each mounted
unit to treat its horses. He is assisted by the
Farriers in his work, and is provided with a pack
horse to carry his veterinary equipment.</p>

<p>Hospitals for sick horses unavoidably left behind
are formed at the Advanced Bases, and at the Base,
where there is also a depôt of Veterinary Stores.
The necessary personnel for these hospitals is provided
by six <dfn>Veterinary Sections</dfn>, each of 2 Officers
and 32 other ranks, with 83 horsekeepers. A Section
can take charge of 250 sick horses. Horses
when cured are transferred to the Remount Depôt.</p>

<p>Veterinary Officers are also allotted for duty
at places where horses are landed, and with the
Remount Depôts. They are also charged with
the duty of inspecting cattle before slaughtering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<h4>THE REMOUNT SERVICE</h4>

<p>The total number of horses in the Field Force
is nearly 70,000, and it is estimated that twice as
many more will be required to keep up this
strength for twelve months of war.</p>

<p>The <dfn>Remount Service</dfn> is formed to supply the
“remounts,” or fresh horses continuously required
to replace those expended in war. The Head of
this Service is the Deputy Director of Remounts.</p>

<p><dfn>Remount Depôts</dfn> are formed at the Base and the
Advanced Bases, where all animals procured for
the use of the Army are taken charge of, trained,
and distributed to the Units. The <dfn>Base Remount
Depôt</dfn> can receive 1,000 animals. It is managed
by a personnel of 11 Officers and 337 other ranks.
The strength of an <dfn>Advanced Remount Depôt</dfn> is
4 Officers and 112 other ranks, and each is adapted
to receive 300 animals.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_60">6. <span class="smcap">The Ordnance Services</span></h3>

<p>Stores of all sorts, except medical and veterinary,
are supplied to the Army by the Ordnance Services.
The supply of ammunition is the most pressing
service, but troops require a variety of other stores—tools
and explosives, boots, clothing, equipment,
and arms. Workshops are required for repairs
of all sorts, especially to vehicles and harness.</p>

<p>The Ordnance Services are controlled by the
Director of Ordnance Stores and his Deputy, under
the Inspector-General of Communications, each
with two Ordnance Officers as assistants. The
organization consists of <dfn>Ordnance Depôt</dfn> units—10
at the Base, 7 at Railhead, and 2 at each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
Advanced Base—which form Ordnance Depôts at
those places. Each unit consists of 2 Officers and
69 clerks, storemen, and artificers, with as much
civil labour as may be required.</p>

<h4>ARRANGEMENTS FOR AMMUNITION SUPPLY</h4>

<p>The main duty of the Ordnance Services is
forwarding ammunition to the front, where it is
taken over by the Fighting Units, at places called
the <dfn>Refilling Points</dfn>, which are generally about a
day’s march in rear of the fighting line. One
Auxiliary Transport Company of 100 wagons is
allotted per Division for carrying ammunition
to these points. To ensure an adequate supply
at the front demands careful organization and
good administration of the Ordnance Services, as
ammunition is expended at uncertain dates, and
in amounts which cannot be forecast.</p>

<p>The amount provided for the Field Force is as
follows:</p>

<h4>GUN AMMUNITION</h4>

<p>1,000 rounds per Field or Horse Artillery gun;
500 per Howitzer and Heavy gun. About half of
this is carried by the Fighting Troops; the rest
is in Ordnance charge on the L. of C.</p>

</table>

<p>With regard to the amount of ammunition
required in the field, it should be noted that the
quantity of Gun Ammunition that may be expended
with quick-firing guns is very great. In
Manchuria, both Russian and Japanese Batteries
have been known to fire 500 rounds per gun in one
day. The amount of Gun Ammunition carried in
the French Army is 2,000 rounds per gun—<i>i.e.</i> 500
rounds with Batteries and Ammunition Columns,
and 500 in the Army Ammunition Park, the Army
Park, and in depôts on the L. of C., respectively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
As to Rifle Ammunition, the Japanese found that
the 270 rounds carried by each man ran out, and
they consider that each man should have 350
rounds available with his Regiment, and 150
more in Ammunition Columns. This makes a
total of 500 with the Fighting Troops, which the
British allowance of 450 nearly approximates.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_61">7. <span class="smcap">The Railway Services</span></h3>

<p>The efficiency of the service of the railways
which generally form the Lines of Communication
is of the utmost importance to the Army, as
on it depends the issue of supplies and ammunition
to the troops at the front, and consequently their
ability to move and fight.</p>

<p>The control of the Railway Services is laid on the
Director of Railways, who is responsible to the
Inspector-General of Communications, and works
under the supervision of the Quarter-Master-General’s
Branch of the Staff.</p>

<p>The work of the Railway Services comprises the
<em>maintenance</em> and <em>working</em>, as well as the <em>repair</em>
(and sometimes the <em>construction</em>), of railways in
the theatre of operations. The personnel of the
Railway Services consists of two entirely separate
bodies. One is termed the <em>Technical Railway
Personnel</em>, and the other the <em>Railway Control
Establishments</em>.</p>

<p>The <dfn>Technical Personnel</dfn> is provided in a friendly
country by the civil railway companies, but in a
hostile country by the Royal Engineers, when it is
organized in a <dfn>Central Railway Establishment</dfn>, two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
<dfn>Railway Districts</dfn>, and three <dfn>Railway Companies</dfn>
of Engineers. There is allotted also, from the two
Lines of Communication Telegraph Companies, a
<dfn>Railway Telegraph Section</dfn> for the exclusive use of
the Railway Service.</p>

<p>The “Central Railway Establishment” and the
two “Railway Districts” are organized in branches
for the following purposes: Management, Traffic,
Engineering, Locomotive, Accounts, Stores. The
total strength of these Units is 51 Officers and
854 other ranks.</p>

<p>The total strength of three “Railway Companies”
is 12 Officers and 732 other ranks.</p>

<p>The <dfn>Railway Control Establishments</dfn> are the
medium of communication between the troops and
the Technical Personnel. Officers of this body are
posted at the chief stations to facilitate the traffic,
arranging all details with the troops, providing
meals at certain stations, and supervising the
movement of men, animals, and stores.</p>

<p>The personnel of the “Railway Control Establishment”
is 7 Officers and 10 clerks and checkers,
distributed to each important station.</p>

<p>The Director of Railways and his personnel have
no responsibility for the technical security of the
railway; for this the “Commander of the Line of
Communication Defences” is responsible.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_62">8. <span class="smcap">The Works Service</span></h3>

<p>The Director of Works carries out all Engineer
services (apart from Railways and Telegraphs)
required on the Lines of Communication.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
One Company of Engineers, without transport, is
allotted for these services, and is supplemented by
civil artisans and unskilled labourers, who are either
brought from home, or hired locally.</p>

<p>The <dfn>works</dfn> on the Lines of Communication are
described in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II.</a> Many are required at
the Base in connection with the heavy work
involved in landing troops, supplies, and stores, and
sending them up to the front. For these purposes
existing works may have to be adapted, or
new ones constructed. All have to be maintained,
and any plant required kept running. Works at
the Base have to be of a semi-permanent character,
in view of possible lengthy operations.</p>

<p>In addition, the Engineer Company provides
workshops, and depôts of stores and material,
which are established at the Base, the Advanced
Bases, and at Railhead, for the use of the Engineers
at the front.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_63">9. <span class="smcap">The Postal Service</span></h3>

<p>A military organization is needed with an Army
in the field, so as to ensure regular postal communication
to and from home. This is a modern
innovation in war, but one of importance to the
comfort and spirits of the troops, and is a service
demanded by their friends at home and by the
nation in general.</p>

<p>This service is controlled by the Director of
Postal Services, who is attached to Head-Quarters
of the Inspector-General of Communications.</p>

<p>A chief Post Office is established at the Base,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
where all incoming or outgoing mail is dealt
with. It has a personnel of 85 of all ranks, furnished
by the “Army Post Office Corps.”</p>

<p>Smaller Post Offices are established at the
Advanced Bases, and others, each of four men, are
allotted to posts on the Lines of Communication,
and to Head-Quarters of Brigades and Divisions in
the field.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_64">10. <span class="smcap">The Accounts Department</span></h3>

<p>The Accounts Department is responsible for
Finance, Accounts, Audit, and the disbursement
of cash for the Army in the field. It is under
the Financial Adviser at Head-Quarters with three
Assistant Advisers.</p>

<p>The personnel of the Department consists of
Accountants, Cashiers, and Field Paymasters.</p>

<p>The Accountants are in the Accounts Offices
at the Base, which are manned by three <dfn>Accounts
Units</dfn>, each with a personnel of 43 Accountants and
Cashiers, with their servants, and 138 Writers.</p>

<p>Each “Base Accounts Unit” is organized to
deal with the accounts of two Divisions, a Cavalry
Division, and a Mounted Brigade. It is under
a Chief Accountant, whose duties include dealing
with Contracts, Store and Supply Accounts, the
Accounts of the Troops, and Audit.</p>

<p>The Cashier Staff is usually at the Base, where
the bills incurred by the various Services are paid,
and any necessary issues of cash on imprest made.</p>

<p>The Field Paymasters are stationed at convenient
places nearer the troops; they provide Commanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
Officers with cash for paying the men, and pay bills
incurred locally, if urgent.</p>

<p>At the Base is the Military Chest, holding the
cash reserve of the Army. That it should be
ample during the Campaign is of vital moment.
Credit notes are a poor substitute for cash in an
enemy’s, or even an ally’s, country. As von der
Golz says, “a full exchequer may be worth an Army
Corps, and a clever financier at the side of the
Commander-in-Chief equal to a first-rate General.”
Cash is required not mainly for the pay of the
troops, but to purchase in the country what the
Army needs, and to pay for the large amount of
civilian labour which will be required on the
L. of C. Cash is also needed to buy information,
or reward inhabitants for services. The immense
importance of having, without fail, ready money
for these purposes—so essential for the operations
of the Army—cannot be over-estimated.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_65">11. <span class="smcap">The Records Branch</span></h3>

<p>The Records Branch supplies, on mobilization,
one Section of clerks for each Division, and for
each Cavalry or Mounted Brigade, to carry on the
clerical work at Head-Quarters of Commands in
the field. Artillery and Engineers supply their
own clerks for their Head-Quarters.</p>

<p>A Record Office is established at the Base, to
carry on all office work in connection with the
personnel from which it is desirable the units in
the field should be entirely freed, such as the soldiers’
attestations and medical history sheets, and
their accounts. From this office, too, are sent to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
England reports, returns, war diaries, and lists
of casualties. It also conducts the clerical work
in connection with invaliding.</p>

<p>The Base Record Office consists of six Sections,
or one for a Division and a Cavalry or Mounted
Brigade. A Section comprises 3 Officers, 4 Staff
Sergeants, and the Orderly Room Clerk of each
Unit belonging to the Division or Brigade allotted
to the Section. There are two divisions in each
Section—one for Infantry Battalions, one for all
other Units.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_66">12. <span class="smcap">Depôts for Personnel</span></h3>

<p>Base Depôts are formed to receive the personnel
left by each Unit at the Base, which comprises
its Band Sergeant, Master Tailor, and Storemen.
The latter take charge of such part of the
men’s equipment as is kept back at the Base, as
not being required in the field, and must yet
be available when needed.</p>

<p>The men of each Unit who form its “First
Reinforcements” are also placed in the Base
Depôt. These are calculated at the rate of 10
per cent. of the rank and file of each Unit in the
Field, with an Officer for every party exceeding
40 men.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE TERRITORIAL FORCE—THE INDIAN ARMY</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 id="hdr_67"><span class="smcap">The Territorial Force</span></h3>

<p>A British “Second Line Army” is provided
by the Territorial Force. It consists of 14 Divisions,
14 Mounted Brigades, and certain “Army
Troops.” These are organized on the same lines
as the regular Units, but differ in the following
points:</p>

<p>1. The Cavalry and Mounted Infantry Units
are both provided by the “Yeomanry,” and consist
of Regiments of 4 Squadrons instead of 3 as in the
regular Cavalry. The Divisional Cavalry is formed
of a Regiment of Yeomanry, instead of 2 Companies
of Mounted Infantry as in the regular
Division.</p>

<p>2. The Artillery is in Batteries of four guns,
instead of six as in the regular Artillery.</p>

<p>3. The Divisional Supply Column is formed of
4 A.S.C. Companies, that is 1 per Brigade and 1 for
the Divisional Troops. There are no Divisional
Supply Parks.</p>

<p>4. There are no Divisional Ammunition Columns.</p>

<p>5. Cyclist Battalions will form part of the Army
Troops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_68"><span class="smcap">The Army of India</span></h3>

<p>The Field Force which can be mobilized in
India for war consists of 9 Divisions and 8 Cavalry
Brigades. It is composed of British and Indian
Troops in combination. This fact necessitates an
organization somewhat different in detail from that
in England, especially as to number of Officers and
men and constitution of Administrative Services.
But, on the whole, the organization of the Army
of India is on the same lines as that of the Home
Army.</p>

<p>The main differences are as follows:</p>

<p>The <dfn>Infantry Brigade</dfn>, which has 4 Battalions
as in the Home Army, is organized for independent
action, having its own Administrative Services—namely:
two Ambulances, a Supply Column, and
a Field Post Office.</p>

<p>The <dfn>Cavalry Brigade</dfn>, like that of the Home
Army, is of 3 Regiments, but the Regiment has
4 Squadrons. The Brigade is also organized for
independent action, having a Horse Artillery
Battery and Ammunition Column, and the
necessary Administrative Services, like the Infantry
Brigade.</p>

<p>The <dfn>Division</dfn> is of three Brigades, with two Field
Companies of Engineers, like the British Division,
but it has an extra Battalion of Pioneers and a
whole Cavalry Regiment. It is weaker in Artillery,
having only one Brigade of Field Artillery, but it
has 2 Mountain Batteries. The Indian Division
has the same Administrative Services as a British<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
Division in England, with a Survey Party in
addition.</p>

<p>The Staff and the Field and Horse Artillery
are <em>British</em>. The Infantry Battalions, Cavalry
Regiments, and Mountain Batteries are either
<em>British</em> or <em>Indian</em>. The Engineer Companies
and Administrative Services are <em>Indian</em>. In all
<em>Indian</em> Units the higher ranks are filled by British
Officers.</p>

<p>The following gives the Establishment of Brigades
and Divisions:</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />

<span class="subhead">SPECIAL FEATURES OF BRITISH WAR ORGANIZATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The most recent developments of Organization are
well illustrated in that of the British Army, which
has been lately reorganized in accordance with the
trend of modern views as to the conduct of War.</p>

<p>Ruskin once wrote that no modern man could
ever realize the amount of <em>thought</em> built into a
Gothic cathedral, where the size and detail of each
part have been designed with reference to the proportion
it bears to the whole, as well as to the
number and dimensions of its fellow members. It
would be equally impossible to sum up in a short
chapter the <em>thought</em> built into the organization of
the British Army. To appreciate its details demands
a thorough knowledge of the working of
each Arm and of each Administrative Service.
Each is planned to be of such strength and composition
as to enable it to perform all that is
required of it, and to ensure that all shall work in
harmonious co-operation under the strain and
friction of War.</p>

<p>Among the points which are especially worth
noticing are the following, which bear out the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
principles of Organization dwelt on in previous
chapters.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_69"><span class="smcap">Organization by Divisions</span></h3>

<p>It was shown in <a href="#CHAPTER_V">Chapter V.</a> that small armies
should be formed of Divisions and not of Army
Corps. This principle has been adopted.</p>

<p>The strength of the British Expeditionary Force
is practically that of three Cavalry Divisions and
three Army Corps of the German Army. The
former comprises 75 Battalions, the equivalent of
nearly 23 Regiments of Mounted Troops, and 492
guns; the latter, 75 Battalions, 24 Cavalry Regiments,
and 468 guns. But the British Force is
organized so as to be more flexible, and to
facilitate and strengthen the Supreme Command.
It is <em>more flexible</em> from the greater number of
Subordinate Commands. It <em>facilitates Command</em>
by having two links fewer in the chain of Command—the
Army Corps and the Regiment. It
<em>strengthens Command</em> by not having any Subordinate
Commander of the importance of the
German Army Corps Commander to reckon
with—a point emphasized by Clausewitz.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Facility of Subdivision</span></h3>

<p>The British organization is so planned that the
Force can be readily divided, when required, into
two Armies, each of which can be provided with
its proportion of Strategic and Protective Cavalry,
and of Army Troops, without disorganizing and
rearranging those Formations.</p>

<p>This principle has been carried throughout the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
Force. Thus, the <em>Cavalry Division</em> can supply any
detached <em>Brigade</em> with the <em>Divisional Troops</em>
required—namely, a Battery of Horse Artillery,
a Field Troop of Engineers, a Section of the Wireless
Telegraph Company, a Field Ambulance, and
a Company of A.S.C. to form the Brigade T. and S.
Column, there being one of each of these <em>Divisional
Units</em> for each Brigade to be detached.</p>

<p>Similarly, the <em>Cavalry Brigade</em> can detach one
of its <em>Regiments</em> provided with Sections from the
Field Troop of Engineers, the Field Ambulance,
and the A.S.C. Company, so as to be self-contained.</p>

<p>In exactly the same manner, the <em>Division</em> of
Infantry can at any time detach a <em>Brigade</em>
provided with its due proportion of all Arms and
Administrative Services, without confusion and
delay.</p>

<p>The <em>Infantry Brigade</em>, also, can detach <em>Battalions</em>
equally self-contained; and the <em>Artillery Brigade</em>
can allot a Section of its Ammunition Column to
any <em>Battery</em> which it may be desirable to detach.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Staff</span></h3>

<p>The following principles have been adopted:</p>

<p>Separation of the General Staff from the
Branches of the Staff charged with Routine and
Administrative work, and making the latter
Branches subordinate to the General Staff for
their general direction, while independent in
their working. This matter has been discussed
in <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">Chapter VI.</a></p>

<p>Reduction of the numbers attached to General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
Head-Quarters, by relegating most of the Directors
of the Administrative Services to the L. of C.
This is very desirable in the case of the Services
which work on the L. of C., in order that the
Directors may be in intimate touch with their
work. As a rule, only the Directors of Army
Signals, Supplies, Transport, and Medical Services
will accompany General Head-Quarters at the front.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cavalry Organization</span></h3>

<p>The view has been accepted that the same body
of Cavalry cannot perform the two often incompatible
duties of obtaining Information, and providing
Security for the Army. This subject has
been fully discussed in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II.</a></p>

<p>The Force is therefore provided with a large
<em>Cavalry Division</em> to form the Independent Cavalry
responsible for Strategic Reconnaissance, and a
smaller body, the <em>Mounted Brigades</em>, for the duty
of Protection.</p>

<p>The Independent Cavalry is no longer hampered
by having to cover the front of the Army with a
protective screen. Its strength of 4 Brigades, or
12 Regiments, with 4 Batteries of Horse Artillery,
makes it equivalent to two Continental Cavalry
Divisions, but, being permanently organized under
one Command, it will have greater flexibility,
and be more prompt and efficient in action, than
the two separate Divisions. As to this, von Bernhardi
says “one strong Division under a single
Command is of far more use than two weak ones.”
This endorses the British organization.</p>

<p>The allotment of Mounted Infantry to replace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
Divisional Cavalry, and to form the bulk of the
protective Mounted Brigades, sets free nearly all
our Cavalry Regiments for their true offensive
function, for which they can be expressly trained.
Our Cavalry Regiments run no risk of being
broken up to provide Divisional Cavalry or Escorts
to Head-Quarters on mobilization, as is unavoidable
for many Continental Cavalry Regiments,
in which case, not only is their real Cavalry training
wasted, but their Head-Quarters are superfluous.
Von Bernhardi recommends a Cyclist Battalion
being attached to each Army Corps to eke out the
Cavalry, a suggestion we have anticipated by the
use of Mounted Infantry.</p>

<p>The organization of Cavalry Regiments and
Brigades in <em>three</em> units tends to facilitate command
and tactical action. Our Yeomanry and
Cavalry in India have the 4-Squadron organization,
and opinions differ as to the value of the
3-Squadron Regiment, but the 3-Regiment Brigade
is undoubtedly a more flexible and efficient instrument
for rapid and decided action than the
weak foreign Brigade of 2 Regiments which von
Bernhardi condemns.</p>

<p>The provision of <em>Mounted Brigades</em>, under the
Army Commander, is an innovation. Their functions
are in foreign armies carried out by the
<em>Divisional Cavalry</em>; but the screen formed by
such Squadrons, acting independently under their
Divisional Commander, can hardly be as continuous
and effective as that provided by the
British Mounted Brigades acting directly under
the orders of the Army Commander.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
The fire action of the Mounted Troops has been
developed, as mentioned in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II.</a> In this
point the British Cavalry, armed with the Infantry
rifle, is undoubtedly in advance of any other. The
use also of Mounted Infantry, peculiar to the
British Service, provides more efficient fire action
for both Army and Divisional Protective Cavalry
than in any other army. This will increase the
power of the <em>protective screen</em> to drive in that of
the enemy, and assist the Advanced Guards to
push on, or at least to hold their ground till the
main body can deploy and come into action.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Machine Guns</span></h3>

<p>Two Machine Guns form an integral part of
Battalions and Cavalry Regiments. This provides
a greater number of these guns than in Continental
armies at present (see page <a href="#Page_34">34</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Field Artillery</span></h3>

<p>The proportion of guns to Infantry has in all
armies been steadily rising during late years. It
is now higher in the British than even in the
German organization, and far higher than in other
armies.</p>

<p>The modern tendency to provide different
natures for different purposes has been followed,
in allotting a <em>Howitzer Brigade</em> and a <em>Heavy
Battery</em> to each Division.</p>

<p>In action a number of assistants are allotted
to each Artillery Commander, to enable him to
use indirect fire with facility, and to combine the
fire of all his guns to the greatest effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ammunition Supply</span></h3>

<p>The organization of the supply of ammunition
in action has been systematized in detail. Ammunition
Columns are organized so as to be divided
readily to accompany detached Batteries, and to
facilitate the supply of ammunition to Infantry,
Cavalry, and Mounted Brigades.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Engineers</span></h3>

<p>Modern war demands more and more the co-operation
of Engineers with other Arms. This
has been recognized in Japan, where a Battalion is
attached to a Division. The British Division has
now 2 Field Companies, or double the number
in Continental armies. Each is provided with
some Bridging Equipment for forming small
bridges without waiting for the “Bridging Trains”
to come up. There are two of these Bridging
Trains, which form part of the Army Troops, and
are ready to be sent to the front whenever it is
foreseen that large bridges will be required on the
forward march of any part of the Army. When
there is no need of them, the Bridging Trains
will march in rear, so as not to block the roads.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Organization of the Division</span></h3>

<p>One of the most important improvements in the
British organization is that a Division is formed
of <em>three</em> Infantry Brigades, instead of the <em>two</em>
nearly universal in foreign armies. This change
has often been recommended by foreign military
experts, notably by von der Golz in his “Nation in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
Arms.” It is economical in Divisional Staff, and
increases the importance and efficiency of the
Divisional Command. It provides 12 Battalions
for a Division, as in Germany, but without the
insertion of an extra link—the <em>Regiment</em>—in the
chain of Command. The almost universal organization
of Infantry in foreign armies in Army
Corps of 2 Divisions, Divisions of 2 Brigades,
and Brigades of 2 Regiments, must be considered,
for reasons already stated, a faulty one.
The British Divisional organization, both in
Infantry and Cavalry, is undoubtedly superior.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Inter-communication</span></h3>

<p>The personnel and equipment necessary for inter-communication
are now provided by a number
of “Communication Units.” These ensure ready
and effective communication between the Commander-in-Chief
and his Cavalry and his Infantry
Divisions, between the Divisions themselves, as
well as internally in each. This is now more
important than ever, owing to the wider dispersion
of the troops, and the absolute necessity of
obtaining early intelligence about the enemy, and
transmitting orders without delay. All means of
Communication, whether by telegraph, <em>wireless</em>,
telephone, day and night signalling, or despatch
riders, should be under <em>one</em> organization. Each
Command—Army, Division, Brigade—is now
provided with means of communication forming
integral portions of the Command, and trained
Regimental Signallers carry on the system from
Brigade Head-Quarters to the troops actually at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
the front. In no other army is the Telegraph
system so completely organized, while Signalling
is but little developed outside England.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Lines of Communication</span></h3>

<p>In the British Service alone has the important
principle been adopted of separating the duties on
the Lines of Communication into two independent
branches, that of their <em>Protection</em>, and that of their
<em>Administration</em>, thus leaving the Officer charged
with their administration to concentrate his attention
on this vital matter. This Officer, the
Inspector-General of L. of C., has now to assist
him an adequate Staff, whose composition is
organized beforehand, and no longer left to be
improvised in war. The organization of the L. of C.
has been remodelled, and the necessary Staffs
allotted to the Base, Railhead, Advanced Depôts,
and smaller posts. This will prevent confusion
at the outset, and facilitate working on the
L. of C.</p>

<p>The organization of the Administrative Services
on the L. of C. has been elaborated in great
detail, to ensure their efficient action. This applies
especially to the <em>Medical Services</em>, whose organization
is now as complete and well thought out
as in any army in the world, and to the <em>Transport</em>
and <em>Supply</em> Services, which, as explained in
<a href="#CHAPTER_VII">Chapter VII.</a>, are closely united, and likely, therefore,
to work better together than in foreign
armies, where Transport is a Combatant Unit,
and Supply a Civil Department.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
The great importance of <em>Railways</em> on the
L. of C. has been fully realized. British war
experience has of late been considerable, and the
personnel required for working railways in war has
been carefully thought out, and organized in great
detail. The number of Railway Units has been
increased, and, in their completion to war strength
on mobilization, full advantage has been taken of
the unrivalled resources of England in highly
trained railway personnel.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Finance and Clerical Work</span></h3>

<p>The financial difficulties met by an Army in the
Field have been faced, and the C.-in-C. relieved
from responsibility for them. An establishment
of personnel to deal with <em>Accounts</em> and <em>Audit</em>
accompanies the Army in the Field, and is
stationed at the Base, so as to systematize the
Finance and Accounts, and facilitate the custody
and issue of cash for necessary administrative
purposes.</p>

<p>A clerical establishment has been established in
the <dfn>Base Records Office</dfn>, which should greatly
relieve the fighting units from all possible
clerical and office work which can be done at
the Base.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Postal Service</span></h3>

<p>A complete <em>Postal Service</em> for the Army in the
Field has now been for the first time provided in
the War Organization.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Reinforcements</span></h3>

<p>The question of Reinforcements has been met
by mobilizing with each Unit what are termed its
<dfn>First Reinforcements</dfn>, at the rate of 10 per cent.
of the rank and file. These accompany their
Units to the theatre of operations, but are at first
left at the Base in depôts which are organized on
mobilization to receive them. From these depôts
they can, when needed, be sent to reinforce their
own Units at the front, without delay or confusion.</p>

<p>Reinforcements of “Second Line” Troops are
provided from the “Imperial Service Section” of
the Territorial Force, who can be sent abroad as
Units for defence of Lines of Communication,
escorting prisoners, guarding conquered territory,
and all duties for which Second Line Troops are
used in foreign armies.</p>

<p>Arrangements for Reinforcements in <em>horses</em> have
been made, by registering private horses at home,
and organizing the collection of horses purchased
abroad, as well as by the organization of Remount
Depôts on the L. of C.</p>

<p>The organization of foreign armies differs considerably
from that of the British Army. They are,
however, all formed on the German model, with
the exception of the Army of the United States.
Their organization is therefore to some extent
identical, and may be understood from the following
table, showing the normal Continental organization,
which has been copied also by Japan. The
organization of the United States has followed
original lines.</p>

<p>Notes are given of the main points in which
some foreign armies differ from the normal
organization.</p>

<p>Then follow tables showing the war organization
of each of the chief armies of the world (1909).
That of the German Army, the typical Continental
Army, is given in greater detail than the
others.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />

<span class="subhead">COMPOSITION OF NATIONAL ARMIES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It may be of interest to glance at the strength of
the Forces which the chief military nations will put
into the field at the outbreak of war. The strength
depends essentially on the number of organized
Formations of Troops. It would be quite erroneous
to estimate it by the total number of
individual soldiers which the nation is estimated
to possess.</p>

<p>Large numbers of untrained men, without organization
to embody them in, add little to actual
military strength.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_80"><span class="smcap">Armies of First Line</span></h3>

<p>The Army which will take the field at the outbreak
of war is the Regular Army, which is
organized, kept up, and trained, year by year,
in peace. The War Army will be this Peace
Army <em>mobilized</em>, or brought up to war strength
and completed in every essential, by calling up
reserve officers and men to fill its ranks.</p>

<p>The Force thus produced is the “Army of First
Line,” and its strength is measured by the number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
of the main Sub-Commands (Army Corps or
Divisions) which the peace organization indicates
that it is intended to form on mobilization. The
men in its ranks are from 20 to 30 years of age.
The Army will, on mobilization, form large <em>depôts</em>
for all its units, on which to draw for reinforcements.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_81"><span class="smcap">Armies of Second Line (Reserve or
Territorial Armies)</span></h3>

<p>Most nations will also mobilize an “Army of
Second Line,” mainly composed of Reserve
Divisions of Infantry. Some of these Divisions
may be inserted in the Army Corps of the First-Line
Force, as in France and Austria; others may
be added independently to some of the Armies, as
in the German Army in 1866 and 1870; in some
cases they may be formed into a separate Reserve
Army, either for support of the Armies in the
Field, or for special operations in a separate
theatre. The main work, however, of the “Second-Line”
Force will be to defend the Lines of
Communication, and provide troops for Sieges, for
Garrisons, and for Coast Defence. It will also
have to guard the railways at home, keep order in
the cities, guard frontiers, and take charge of
prisoners. Germany provides an Army of Third
Line, called the Landwehr or Home Defence
Army, for the latter purposes.</p>

<p>Until late years no country but Prussia had an
Army of Reserve, or a “Territorial Army.” Its
formation to replace loose levies, or “National
Guards,” has been a great step in organization for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
war. The latter, being practically improvised
bodies, were deficient in discipline and cohesion,
even if inspired by patriotism and courage. Territorial
Forces, on the contrary, are to some extent
organized, at least with “cadres”—that is, in skeleton—the
officers for them being allotted beforehand;
their personnel, too, will consist to some
extent of men who have had more or less training;
their arms and equipment can be provided in peace.
The process, therefore, of mobilizing a Territorial
Force will be far less hasty and confused than in
the case of new levies. At the same time, “Second-Line
Armies” are never so well organized as those
of First Line. They comprise an undue proportion
of Infantry to the other Arms, and will be
weak in Cavalry, guns, and Engineers; their
Administrative Services will be mainly improvised;
they will be officered by old regular officers, or non-professional
younger ones; the men will have been
some years away from the ranks, and their training
will be rusty. The formation, too, of Reserve Units
will generally have to be postponed until the heavy
work of mobilizing and concentrating the First-Line
Army is completed. In German opinion the
Reserve Army is not fit to be placed in first line at
the beginning of a war.</p>

<p>The British Territorial Force differs from all
others in being completely organized with a correct
proportion of all Arms and Services, and provided
in peace with Subordinate Commanders and their
Staff, besides being trained annually.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_82"><span class="smcap">Reserves</span></h3>

<p>In addition to the above Reserve Forces, all
foreign nations possess a last resource in the shape
of a great number of men, many of whom, however,
have received no training at all. Being totally
unorganized, they could only be used as reserve
men to fill the depôts of the organized Forces,
and should not rightly be counted in to swell the
numbers of available troops.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to glance at the actual
forces which Germany could produce for war, as
her army may be taken as the best developed
example of the modern national armies of Europe.</p>

<blockquote class="hang2">

<p><i>A.</i> Army of First Line: 23 Army Corps and
14 Cavalry Divisions, with their Depôts.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> Reserve Army, of Second Line: 48 Infantry
Divisions, formed by Cadres taken from
the Standing Army in peace, and filled by
men who have passed through the Army
into the Reserve.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> Landwehr Army, of Third Line: 30 to 40
Brigades of Infantry—that is, 1 per Division,
or perhaps only 1 per Army Corps, of
the Standing Army.</p></blockquote>

<p>Cadres for <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> are formed as follows:</p>

<p>Each <em>Infantry Regiment</em> of the Army in peace
forms on mobilization:</p>

<blockquote class="hang2">

<p>(<i>a</i>) A Depôt for itself, to supply drafts.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A Reserve Regiment for B.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) 1 or 2 Companies of a “Landwehr” Regiment
for C.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
Each <em>Cavalry Regiment</em> forms its own depôt
with its 5th Squadron, and provides 2 reserve
Squadrons for <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>.</p>

<p><em>Artillery</em> and <em>Pioneers</em> form a few units for <i>B</i>
and <i>C</i>.</p>

<p>The <em>Train</em> does the same, but can only supply
rudimentary units.</p>

<h4>TOTAL WAR STRENGTH</h4>

<p>The following table shows the strength of the
Armies of First and Second Line which could be
put into the field by the various military nations
at the beginning of a war. The strength is shown
in Army Corps and Divisions, and the Armies are
placed in two Categories:</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The larger ones, organized by Army Corps.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> Those organized by Divisions.</p>

<p>The strength shown does not include Troops
raised in the Colonies, nor those garrisoning outlying
possessions, such as the Russian Army Corps
in the Caucasus and Siberia, or the British garrisons
of Coaling Stations.</p>

<p>The British 7th Division, made up of the Mediterranean
and Cape garrisons, and the French
Army Corps in Algeria, are, however, included.</p>

<p>The numbers of Cavalry and Reserve Divisions
are conjectural, as in most cases they are only
formed for war.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_84">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p>This interesting subject can only be treated very
cursorily, but it is hoped to present a general
view of the developments which have taken place
in the organization of armies in the field, since the
introduction of firearms.</p>

<p>The method adopted for describing this process
of evolution is as follows:</p>

<p>The beginnings of organization, and the earliest
organized forces—those of the Reiters and
Landsknechts in the fifteenth century—are briefly
described.</p>

<p>An account follows of the subsequent development
of organization in each Arm of the Service
separately, noting especially the armies which
stand out as the best organized of their time—namely,
the Dutch Army of Maurice of Nassau,
and the Swedish of Gustavus Adolphus.</p>

<p>A description is given of the “New Model”
Army raised by the Parliament in their struggle
with Charles I., which is a typical example of
seventeenth-century organization. The New
Model is of especial interest to Englishmen, not
only from the unmatched quality and unbroken
success which make it one of the most remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
armies in history, but because its organization
still survives to a great extent in the British Army
of to-day.</p>

<p>After describing the organization of armies
during the eighteenth century, the great changes
introduced in the wars of the French Revolution
are discussed, and it is shown how modern forms
of organization have resulted from them.</p>

<p>A chapter is devoted to the development of
the Staff, and more especially that of the General
Staff, and some remarks are then given on the
evolution of the Services of Transport and Supply,
and of Medical Organization for War.</p>

<p>Throughout these chapters notice is taken of
the period at which our military terms were introduced,
and the way in which they obtained their
special signification—a subject of some interest
in connection with organization. These facts are
embodied for reference in a list of military terms,
showing their origin and derivation, given in
<a href="#hdr_130">Appendix A</a>.</p>

<p>In this connection it did not seem out of place
to make some remarks on the inconsistencies and
ambiguities of our present Military Terminology,
with the view of pointing out the desirability
of reforming it. These remarks are given in
<a href="#hdr_131">Appendix B</a>.</p>

<span class="subhead">ORGANIZATION IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY</span></h2>
</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Sketch of the Origin of Organization
as seen in the Early Standing Armies
of Europe</span></h3>

<p id="hdr_85">The organization of armies in the ancient world,
or in Asia in more recent times, must be regarded
as beyond the scope of this work. The history of
Organization will be taken up at the time when
the use of firearms had begun to revolutionize
fighting, and transform the feudal levies of the
Middle Ages into regular armies.</p>

<p>Modern organization dates from the close of the
Feudal Epoch in the fifteenth century, after
which wars were waged less for national purposes
than for the furtherance of dynastic or State
interests, and were no longer carried on by the
levy of the nation, but by mercenaries hired by the
Monarch or the State.</p>

<p>This process originated in Italy, where the
rivalry of the trading republics caused them to
engage Swiss, English, and other mercenaries to
fight their neighbours. Hence we find that military
organization in its modern form originated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
in Italy, and that in consequence most military
terms are derived from Italian, as may be seen in
such words as <em>infantry</em>, <em>cavalry</em>, <em>colonel</em>, <em>squadron</em>,
<em>battalion</em>, <em>regiment</em>. This nomenclature was definitely
adopted by the French after their invasion
of Italy in 1496, and, through French, has passed
into universal use. Thus, by 1524, we find <em>Colonel</em>
used in France, whence it reached England in
the time of Elizabeth, along with <em>Regiment</em>,
<em>Cavalry</em>, and <em>Infantry</em>.</p>

<p>Permanent regular forces are first found in
France near the end of the fifteenth century,
when the King raised <em>Companies</em> of men-at-arms
(gens d’armes) or armoured horsemen, and of foot
archers and halberdiers, of whom his Scottish
Guards were the finest type. Up to that time the
“Lance”—that is, the fully armoured knight with
his retinue of a squire, a page, and three or four
mounted men—formed the principal element of
every military force. A number of such independent
Lances, jealous of each other, and
untrained to act together, could not be <em>organized</em>
in the modern sense. Besides these mounted men,
there was usually a mass of men on foot unarmoured
and ill-armed, undisciplined and untrained.
In feudal times it was only the English
archers, the Genoese crossbowmen, and the Swiss
halberdiers who had the discipline and training to
make them of any account as Infantry.</p>

<p>The word <dfn>company</dfn> in its military sense denoted
originally the gathering of feudal retainers who
followed their lord to the wars; it then came to
mean the band who obeyed a <em>Captain</em> (<em>caput</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
<em>head</em>), some noted leader among the mercenaries
from whom regular armies sprang. The word
<em>company</em> is derived from the Old French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">compainie</i>,
the Latin <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">companion-em</i> (<em>companion</em>), from <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">cum-pane</i>
(<em>with bread</em>), implying an intimate association
of men in one mess.</p>

<p>The Company of Horse was soon differentiated
from that of Foot, by being called a <em>Troop</em>—a
word of uncertain origin, by some connected with
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">turba</i> (a <em>crowd</em>), by others with the root of the
Teutonic <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">treiben</i> (<em>drive</em>), and akin to a <em>drove</em>.</p>

<p>The strength of a Company was at first indefinite,
and amounted to some hundreds of men, but it
was gradually made smaller, so as to be more
flexible and mobile. The practice of the most
successful leaders finally reduced it to a definite
body of about a hundred men, which it was found
was the largest number which could with certainty
be reached by the voice, and commanded by one
man, in battle.</p>

<p>This strength of one hundred men was that of
a Company of the Scottish Guards in France,
and is found in England in the troops and companies
of the army of Henry VIII.; it is still that
of our Companies to-day.</p>

<p>The assemblage of a number of Companies
and Troops made up the <em>Army</em> (from the
French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Armée</i>, Italian <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Armata</i>, or <em>armed host</em>).
Its <em>Commander</em> (Old French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Commandaire</i>, Late
Latin <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Commandator</i>, a word which occurs in
English in the fourteenth century) was styled the
King’s <em>Constable</em> (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Comes Stabuli</i>, or <em>Master of the
Horse</em>), a dignity as old as the early Frankish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
Kings. His Second-in-Command was the <em>Marshal</em>
(Old French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mareschal</i>, Late Latin <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Mariscalcus</i>,
from Teutonic <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">mara</i>, <em>horse</em>, and <em>skalk</em>, <em>servant</em>).
Down to our day the title of the highest military
rank in France has always been <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Maréchal de
France</i>. But there was also a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Maréchal de Camp</i> of
lower rank, only immediately senior to a Colonel,
so that the Germans made a mistake when, in the
eighteenth century, they translated the latter, and
not the former, title, and called their highest rank
of Officer <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Feld-Marschal</i>, which we have adopted
as <em>Field-Marshal</em>. The difference between the
two titles may be exemplified by Marshal Belleisle’s
remark on Montcalm’s exploit at Ticonderoga:
“If it were <em>possible</em> for the King to make a
Maréchal de Camp a Maréchal de France, he
would do it for Montcalm.”</p>

<p>The term <em>Constable</em> for the Supreme Commander
soon dropped out, and was replaced by
<em>Marshal</em>, and later by <em>Captain-General</em>, which
lasted down to Marlborough’s time. The word
<em>Commander-in-Chief</em>, which does not occur in
English till the middle of the seventeenth century,
came into use as the official title early in the
eighteenth.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Regiment</span></h3>

<p>It had become usual by the sixteenth century to
raise soldiers by larger bodies than the Company
or Troop, and these were called <em>Regiments</em>, from
being under the <em>regiment</em>, or <em>rule</em>, of one man.
This officer was called the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Oberst</i>, or <em>uppermost
man</em>, in Germany, but in other countries the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
<em>Colonel</em>. This word comes from the Italian <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Colonello</i>
(<em>little column</em>), which perhaps meant the leading
Company, or that of the Colonel. In Spanish it is
<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Coronel</i>, which seems to have given rise to our
pronunciation of the word.</p>

<p>The Colonel practically owned the Regiment he
raised, and especially the first Company of it, from
which he derived his emoluments. It thus became
a practice for men of position to raise Regiments,
first of Horse—then the nobler Arm—and later of
Foot also. Such noblemen were often too busy, or
too grand, to attend personally to their Regiment,
and soon became mere absentees. Their Command
was then gradually transferred to their <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">locum tenens</i>,
the <em>lieu-tenant</em> of the Colonel, so called because the
Command of the Company, or Troop, of which
the Colonel was nominally the Captain, always
devolved on his Lieutenant. Thus the officer
styled the <em>Lieutenant-Colonel</em> began to act as
Commander of the Regiment, as he is to this day
in England.</p>

<h4 id="hdr_86">EARLIEST REGIMENTAL ORGANIZATION</h4>

<p>The origin of the modern organization of Regiments
of Horse and Foot can be traced in most
of its details to that of the German <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Landsknecht</i>
Infantry and <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Reiter</i> Cavalry in Germany
towards the end of the fifteenth century. The
organization of both was nearly identical, being no
doubt adapted from the Swiss, and the Italian
<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Condottieri</i>, or the English <em>Free Companies</em>, typical
fourteenth-century mercenaries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
The Regiment was raised as follows: A leader
of distinction, the <em>Colonel</em>, selected his <em>Captains</em>;
the latter raised the Troops or Companies to form
the Regiment, by enlisting recruits in their districts
with beat of drum and proclamation, exactly as
in England for centuries later. The Captain of
Horse was called <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Rittmeister</i> (<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Reiter meister</i>, or
<em>master of Reiters</em>), and the Captain of Foot, <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Hauptmann</i>
(<em>Head-man</em>), as they are in Germany to this
day.</p>

<p>The Colonel chose his <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">locum tenens</i>, or <em>Lieutenant</em>,
as did also each Captain. A <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Fähnrich</i> (<em>Flagbearer</em>)
was appointed to each Troop or Company,
that his flag might present a conspicuous rallying
point. To the Flagbearer was attached a
<em>Trumpeter</em> in each Troop of Horse, or a <em>Fifer</em> and
<em>Drummer</em> in each Company of Foot, so that the
men could rally to the flag by sound, as well as by
sight, in the confusion of battle. The flag of the
Horse was triangular or hornshaped, whence it
was called in French a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Cornette</i>, while that of the
Foot was square, and termed the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Enseigne</i> (Latin
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Insignium</i>). Hence the officers who carried the
flags were later designated <em>Cornets</em> and <em>Ensigns</em>,
in Cavalry and Infantry Regiments respectively.
These titles for the junior Lieutenants who carried
the flags survived in England till late in the
nineteenth century, and it seems a pity to have
replaced so picturesque and concise a designation
of rank by the cumbrous and un-English term
<em>Second Lieutenant</em>.</p>

<p>There were thus, in each Troop or Company,
three Officers, the <em>Captain</em>, the <em>Lieutenant</em>, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
<em>Ensign</em>, the same found in the subsequent organization
of all armies.</p>

<p>Besides these three officers, each Troop of
Reiters had a <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Wachmeister</i>, and each Company of
Landsknechts a <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Feldwebel</i>, terms still retained in
Germany with the meaning of <em>Sergeant</em>. This
officer was of great importance in the unit, as
he was charged with its drills in peace, and with
its manœuvres in battle, when the other officers
were in front fighting, and could not watch the
men. As the Sergeant had to give orders in action,
he became also responsible for Orders at all times,
so that he was virtually a kind of Adjutant to the
unit. In battle the Infantry Sergeant had to run
up and down the Company to supervise its movements;
he, therefore, could not well be encumbered
with the long pike, but retained the earlier halberd,
which survived as the special arm of the Sergeant
of Infantry in England down to 1829.</p>

<p>There was similarly in the <em>Regiment</em> a corresponding
officer, the <em>Sergeant-Major</em>, later styled
simply the <em>Major</em>, as he still is. He was practically
a Staff Officer, or Adjutant, to the Colonel, exactly
as the <em>Sergeant</em> was to the Captain. He issued
the Colonel’s orders to the Sergeants, and was
responsible for the drill of the Regiment, and its
manœuvres in battle. He was therefore mounted,
even in the Infantry Regiment, like our Adjutant
to-day, in order that he might move rapidly up and
down the Regiment, to superintend its movements
and give orders to the Sergeants of the various
Companies.</p>

<p>There was also in the Reiters a <em>Quarter-Master</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Fourier</i> (as the French still style him), with
a subordinate (now the Quarter-Master-Sergeant).
His duties were to provide <em>quarters</em>, and, as the
men had to be fed in these quarters, he became
charged in addition with <em>subsistence</em>, exactly as
is our Quarter-Master to-day. In old times the
Quarter-Master was also responsible for <em>reconnaissance</em>,
which was no doubt due to the fact that,
having to precede the troops on the march, so as to
provide quarters for them that evening, it fell to
him to decide on the correct route, and he had,
therefore, to reconnoitre to the front. What are
now the Staff duties of reconnaissance and
directing marches became thus associated with
the Quarter-Master of each unit, and afterwards
with the corresponding officer, the Quarter-Master-General
of the whole army. Therefore, down to a
few years ago, the Q.M.G. was charged with all
Staff work connected with marches, routes, reconnaissance,
and information—a curious survival
through four centuries of the organization of the
Reiters.</p>

<p>As regards subordinates, or, as we should now
say, non-commissioned officers, there was a <em>File-Master</em>
(<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Rottmeister</i>) at the head of each file, for
the Troop or Company was drawn up in very deep
formation. This specially selected soldier was
called <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Capo di Squadra</i> (<em>Head of the Squad</em>) in
Italian, a reminiscence of the early formation
of the smallest fighting body (our <em>Squad</em>) in a
square (<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Squadra</i>). From <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Capo di Squadra</i> came
the French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Caporal</i> (which we have rendered <em>Corporal</em>,
by false derivation from <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">corporalis</i>, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">corpus</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
<em>body</em>), who is still the Squad leader. The fact that
they originally stood in the ranks at the head of the
files accounts for the inclusion of Corporals, but
not Sergeants, in the expression <em>Rank and File</em>,
for the Sergeants were out of the ranks, superintending
the men, as they are to-day.</p>

<p>The organization of a Regiment of Reiters or of
Landsknechts, as described above, became by the
end of the sixteenth century general in all armies,
and has, in essentials, survived in modern Regimental
organization. The Regiment bore the name
of the man who raised it or succeeded to its command,
down into the nineteenth century, although
<em>Numbers</em> began to replace personal <em>Names</em> as titles
of Regiments, during the eighteenth. The Regiment,
whether of Cavalry or Infantry, was rather
the administrative than the tactical unit on the
battlefield, and formed, as to-day, the permanent
organization through which the men received their
pay, clothing, and subsistence. Hence arose the
strong and lasting regimental traditions and esprit-de-corps,
which survive in the older armies to-day.</p>

<p id="hdr_87">The first country to possess a formidable Standing
Army was Spain, in the sixteenth century, and
her example was soon followed by France, the
Empire, and the Netherlands, and in the next
century by Sweden, England, and Prussia.</p>

<p>The most important developments in war organization
were due to great military reformers, whose
armies became the model of their day to all other
countries. These were Maurice of Nassau, who
led the Dutch in their terrible struggle with Spain
towards the close of the sixteenth century, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, who a few
years later formed the famous army which carried
all before it during the Thirty Years’ War. The
improvements introduced by these great soldiers
will be described in the following chapters, which
deal with the evolution of the organization of each
Arm separately.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />

<span class="subhead">THE EVOLUTION OF INFANTRY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>During the sixteenth century, foot soldiers began
to be called <em>Infantry</em> (French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Infanterie</i>), after
the practice of the Italian <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Condottieri</i>, who used
to call their soldiers their “lads,” as English
officers have always had a habit of doing. They
used the word <em>Fanti</em>, from Latin <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Infans</i>, a child
who could not talk (<em>in</em>, <em>not</em>, and <em>fari</em>, <em>speak</em>).
Similarly, Blücher addressed his men on their
toilsome march to Waterloo as “meine Kinder”
(“my children”), and Americans talk of their
soldiers as “the boys.”</p>

<p>The rise of Infantry from its position of abject
inferiority to the mounted men-at-arms may be
dated from the fourteenth century, when English
archers overthrew the chivalry of France at Cressy
and Poictiers, and Swiss halberdiers that of Austria
at Morgarten and Sempach. In the next century
the Swiss phalanxes (who had now replaced their
halberds by pikes) defeated the Burgundian Horse
at Morat and Nancy, thus assuring the independence
of their country. About the same time the
Hussite peasants of Bohemia, effectively organized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
by their great leader, John Zisca, were holding
their own against the horsemen of Austria.
Towards the end of the fifteenth century a new
type of Infantry arose in the Suabian Landsknechts
(country fellows), an appellation corrupted
into “Lance Knights” in England, and “Lansquenets”
in France. They imitated and improved
on the organization and tactics of their neighbours,
the Swiss, and soon began to rival them as Infantry.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_88"><span class="smcap">The Halberd and Pike</span></h3>

<p>Like the Swiss, the Landsknechts were armed
with the long pike. The halberd, discarded during
the fifteenth century, was a formidable weapon,
with its triple combination of pike head for thrusting,
axe blade for striking, and crook to drag the
horseman down. But its eight-foot shaft was not
so effective against a charge of Horse as a hedge
of eighteen-foot spikes, with butts on the ground,
in the hands of half-a-dozen ranks, one behind the
other. The pike now became the general arm of
Infantry, and only finally disappeared in 1700.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Firearm</span></h4>

<p>Modern Infantry, however, knows not the pike,
and may be said to have really originated when
firearms were first carried by foot soldiers. Of
these weapons the first was the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">arquebus</i> (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">arc-bouche</i>,
or <em>bow with a mouth</em>), a short tube carried in
a small log or stick, the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">stock</i> (German for <em>stick</em>).
The charge was fired from the breast by applying,
to a hole called the vent, the lighted end of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
<em>match</em>, or rope steeped in saltpetre so as to
smoulder. In the fifteenth century we find the
arquebus made longer, and of smaller bore, and the
stock shaped so as to fire from the shoulder. It
was then provided with a cock to hold the match,
and bring it down at the side of the barrel on a
pan filled with a priming of powder, which fired
the charge through a side vent.</p>

<p>About 1520 the Spaniards began to make
several improvements in the firearm. It was
made of larger bore, and all were of uniform
calibre, whence it was called a <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">caliver</i>. Being
heavier, a forked rest was provided to fire from.
About 1530 a lock, copied (like the shaped stock)
from the crossbow, was added, so as to bring the
cock and match sharply down on the pan. The
perfected matchlock was called a <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">musquet</i>, and its
use spread from Spain into Flanders, and thence
through Europe in the sixteenth century. In the
next century it was made lighter, which allowed
the rest to be abolished.</p>

<p>The <em>musket</em>, as it was spelt later, then became the
general firearm of the Infantryman or Musketeer,
until replaced by the rifle in the nineteenth century.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Musketeers</span></h4>

<p>At first, only a few picked men were armed
with muskets, and were styled “the Shot.” They
were employed to skirmish on the flanks of “the
Pikes,” among whom they took refuge when
attacked. But as their efficiency and fire power
increased, Musketeers grew in importance and
numbers, till the end of the sixteenth century,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
Maurice of Nassau had an equal number of
soldiers termed “Shots” and “Pikes” in his
Companies. Infantry had now asserted its superiority
to Horsemen, who could neither break the
central mass of Pikes, nor endure the fire of the
Musketeers on the flanks.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_89"><span class="smcap">Infantry under Maurice of Nassau</span></h3>

<p>Maurice’s army represented the best organization
of the period, and was the model followed fifty
years later in the Parliamentary wars by his
British allies in the Netherlands. His Companies
and Regiments were not yet of fixed strength;
they were organized on the same lines as the
Landsknechts, but were formed of equal numbers
of Pikemen and Musketeers. He introduced the
division of the Company into three Sections, each
under an Officer, with a Corporal, two Sergeants,
and three Drummers. Maurice, owing to improved
drill and discipline, was able to reduce the deep
formations of his day to ten ranks, which was the
least which would give continuous fire by the
method then necessary, which consisted of each
man retiring to the rear when he had fired, so
as to get time for the slow operation of reloading.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_90"><span class="smcap">Brigades</span></h3>

<p>Maurice drew up his army for battle according
to the old Swiss fashion in three lines, styled
“van,” “battle,” and “rear,” and each line constituted
a <em>Brigade</em>, a new, but as yet an indefinite,
unit, composed of several Regiments. This is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
first introduction of that term, which is derived
from the Italian <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">briga</i>, French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">brigue</i> (a <em>quarrel</em>),
and means “a band of opposing combatants.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Battalions</span></h3>

<p>The <em>Battalion</em> has, from the fifteenth century
onwards, always been the fighting unit of Infantry.
<em>Battalion</em>—French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bataillon</i>—is in Italian <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Battaglione</i>
(<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">battaglia</i>, or <em>battle array</em>).</p>

<p>In the early sixteenth century, when the <em>Company</em>
was only an administrative unit, the <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Battaglie</i>
were its tactical subdivisions, and formed small
units fighting separately. Hence <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Battaglione</i>,
“the great battaglia,” was the name given to a
large fighting unit and consisting of a mass comprising
several Regiments and some thousands of
men. This “Battalion” was gradually diminished
in size, to meet changes in tactics which demanded
a more flexible formation for mobility, and a
smaller target, less vulnerable to the rude artillery
of the day. The experience of the more successful
leaders pointed eventually to forming a Battalion
of a few hundred men, so that two or three could
be furnished by a Regiment, instead of forming a
huge Battalion of several Regiments. The fact
that sometimes the Regiment formed only one
Battalion accounts for the constant confusion
between the two terms, and their indiscriminate
use even to-day.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Spanish Infantry—Sixteenth Century</span></h3>

<p>The remarkable efficiency of the Spanish Infantry
which was fighting against Maurice for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
domination of the Netherlands should not be
overlooked. They had, besides musketeers, bodies
of swordsmen with bucklers, active enough to
overcome the pikemen. The Spaniards were the
first to establish depôts for their army in war,
where recruits could be trained by a few old
soldiers. Their Regiments were of some 1,700
men, and the Companies varied from 150 to 300.
The good order of the Spanish Army, and its
strict discipline, were its most remarkable features.
In the latter half of the sixteenth century the
Spanish Infantry was undoubtedly the best in
Europe.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_91"><span class="smcap">Infantry under Gustavus</span></h3>

<p>The next development of Infantry is seen in the
Swedish Army as organized in the Thirty Years’
War by the great Gustavus Adolphus, King of
Sweden. Its efficiency and success made it the
model of the organization of all the armies in
Europe, and they still retain its main features.</p>

<p>Gustavus modelled his army on that of Maurice,
but made many improvements in it. His purpose
was to increase mobility, and to adopt a definite
organization of units. With the first object, he
lightened the musket, so as to do away with the
cumbrous rest, and increased rapidity of fire by
adopting a cartridge to hold the powder. He
added to the Musketeers till they equalled the
Pikemen, and improved the mobility of the latter
by shortening the pike.</p>

<p>As regards organization, he adopted Brigades
much smaller than those of Maurice, and made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
them a definite unit of two Regiments of Infantry,
as they still are in every foreign army.</p>

<p>The Regiment had always been the administration
unit, and the Battalion the tactical unit.
Gustavus definitely fixed the size of the Battalion,
two of which formed a Regiment. Here we find
the origin of the two-Battalion Regiment, which
was universal in Europe for the next hundred
years.</p>

<p>The Regiment was 100 strong, and was divided
into eight Companies, so that the Battalion had
four Companies. Hence we find that Battalions
in foreign armies have always had four Companies,
putting on one side the Grenadier and Light
Infantry Companies, which were added later, as
described on page <a href="#Page_190">190</a>. The British Regiment,
which was not divided into Battalions, kept the
eight-Company organization of Gustavus, and,
when eventually a second Battalion was added,
it kept the same number of Companies.</p>

<p>The Regimental Officers were those of the
Landsknechts—the <em>Colonel</em>, the <em>Lieutenant-Colonel</em>,
and the <em>Sergeant-Major</em> or Staff Officer, called
later the <em>Major</em>. Four Surgeons were added to
the Regimental Staff, which was a new departure,
as up to this time medical arrangements had been
the concern of the Captains only.</p>

<p>The Company comprised 72 muskets and 54
pikes, and was divided into six Sections, each
under a Corporal, four being of musketeers and
two of pikemen. The two Sections of musketeers
on each flank formed a new fighting unit, the
<em>Platoon</em> (French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">peloton</i>, a <em>little bundle</em>), which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
could act independently of the rest of the Company
under the Lieutenant or Ensign, while the Captain
commanded the two centre Sections of pikes.
When pikes were eventually given up, the centre
Sections disappeared, and the two Platoons on the
flanks then constituted the whole Company. A
Platoon thus became a Half-Company, as the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Peloton</i> still is in France. <em>Platoon fire</em> (Half-Company
volleys) was in use in the British Army
till the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>There were thus eight Platoons in the Battalion.
We shall find that they still formed the fighting
units in the Infantry of Frederick the Great, the
Companies being then only the administrative
units, although they subsequently superseded the
Platoons as the fighting units of the Battalion.</p>

<p>The Company Officers were, as in the Landsknechts,
the <em>Captain</em>, the <em>Lieutenant</em>, the <em>Ensign</em>,
and the <em>Sergeant</em>. The latter had an assistant,
the <em>Second Sergeant</em>, and there were 4 <em>Under-Sergeants</em>,
besides the 6 <em>Corporals</em> of Sections.
Three Fifes were added to the three Drums in
each Company, in which we see the origin of the
Drum and Fife Band.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_92"><span class="smcap">French Infantry</span></h3>

<p>During the wars of Louis XIV., in the latter
part of the seventeenth century, the development
of Infantry was advanced by the reduction of the
number of pikes to one-third of the Battalion, and
then to a quarter and a fifth, till at last they were
only found in a central group in each Company,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
so small as to be called a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Picquet</i>, or “<em>little body
of pikes</em>,” whence the word <em>Picket</em>, meaning the
Support of the Outposts, probably because the
musketeers furnished the sentries and the pikes
the Support.</p>

<p>The pike was replaced in France about 1670
by the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bayonet</i>, named after the city of Bayonne,
and probably suggested by the habit of the
Basques of fixing the wooden handles of their
long knives into the muzzles of their guns when
smuggling in the Pyrenees. As the musket could
not be fired with the bayonet fixed, its use was
inconvenient, till the idea occurred about 1700 of
attaching it by a ring clasping the muzzle. The
British Army adopted the bayonet by 1688. The
musketeer had become virtually a pikeman too.
The pike, now unnecessary, was abolished in all
armies about 1700, but in England it survived for
a century in the <em>spontoon</em>, a short pike carried
by junior Officers, just as the halberd had survived
for Sergeants.</p>

<p>In the French Army, under Louis XIV., we
find the <em>Brigade</em> an important unit in the organization
of Infantry. Colonels were selected for this
Command, which gave an opportunity for promoting
the best men, without infringing the vested
right of the Colonel to his own Regiment.</p>

<p>One of the early Brigadiers so selected was
the famous Martinet, whose discipline has become
proverbial. He was Colonel of the Model Regiment
formed in 1668, and afterwards Inspector-General
of Infantry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_93"><span class="smcap">Fusiliers</span></h3>

<p>After the middle of the seventeenth century
an important change in the firearm was invented,
by which the charge was ignited by flint and steel
instead of match, giving more certainty to the fire.
The new flintlock was called a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fusil</i> (from <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fucile</i>,
<em>flint</em>); it was at first given to picked shots, called
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Fusiliers</i>, for skirmishing work, but about 1700
all Infantry were armed with flintlocks. It was
introduced in Great Britain in the shape of
“Brown Bess,” the musket used until rendered
obsolete by the introduction of the percussion cap
in 1840.</p>

<p>The individual Fusiliers carried out what were
later termed the duties of Light Infantry (see p. <a href="#Page_188">188</a>).
By their superior shooting and activity they were
better fitted to move rapidly in front of the heavier
Infantry, so as to annoy the enemy by their fire,
and clear the way for the main body. These
Fusiliers were before long grouped into separate
Battalions of Fusiliers, which were created in
France in 1671, and later in England and Prussia,
where they survive to this day.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Grenadiers</span></h3>

<p>During the Thirty Years’ War <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">grenades</i> (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">grenada</i>,
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pomegranate</i>) or hand-thrown bombs were
introduced. This brought in another variety of
Infantry. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Grenadiers</i> were powerful, tall men,
picked from the Battalion to throw the grenades.
They were soon collected into one “Grenadier<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
Company,” which was added to those of each
Battalion, and took its place on their right.</p>

<p>This was done in France in 1667, and in England
in 1678. Grenadiers then gave up their special
duty, and were armed with the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fusil</i> for Light
Infantry duties, for which, however, they were
eventually found too heavy and slow.</p>

<p>The Grenadier Company continued during the
eighteenth century to form the right Company
of the Battalion in most European armies. Some
of the Grenadiers were assembled in special
Grenadier Regiments, like the “Grenadier Guards”
in England. In Germany and Russia the title
exists to this day, although the special functions
of Grenadiers have been obsolete for two
centuries.</p>

<p>Thus, during the later portion of the seventeenth
century, there were four different kinds of
Infantry—<em>Pikemen</em>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Musketeers</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Grenadiers</i>, and
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Fusiliers</i>.</p>

<p>The changes in armament had the effect of
reducing the number of ranks in battle. The first
phalanxes of pikes had 25 ranks, which Maurice
reduced to 10, and Gustavus to 6; by 1700 the
number of ranks had become 4, which Frederick
reduced to 3, and Wellington, on entering Spain
in 1808, to 2. Two ranks became the rule in
Great Britain in 1824, and in the French service
in 1859. The Prussians were the last to give up
three ranks, in 1888, but the third rank had long
been used only for skirmishing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Light Infantry</span></h3>

<p>The changes in the evolution of Infantry may
be seen to be due to an ever-acting desire to have
some picked troops, more mobile, and better
armed than the rest—that is, <em>Light Infantry</em>, as
they were styled later. The object of these
troops was that they should act in advance, or
on the flank, of the main portion of the army.
They would thus guard it against surprise when
at rest, or on the march, or in battle break the
force of the attack by what became known as
<em>skirmishing</em> (from Italian <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">scherma</i>, <em>fencing</em>). Such
Light Infantry were first seen at the battle of
Pavia, in 1525, when 1,500 arquebusiers were
extended in front of the Battalions. At first these
picked troops were formed out of each Battalion,
but there arose a general tendency to gather them
under one Command, and form them into special
Companies. The same tendency soon began to
group these Companies into special Battalions,
which gradually lost all idea of their special
functions, and tended to become ordinary Infantry,
while retaining their original special designation.
We see this process acting when the Grenadiers
were found too heavy for “light Infantry” work;
and these duties were then allotted to the “Fusiliers,”
or picked shots armed with the light fusil,
who eventually became Fusilier Battalions. These,
like the Grenadier Battalions, had by the end of
the seventeenth century given up their distinctive
mode of action, and become identical with the
rest of the Infantry, while retaining the title of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
Fusiliers; so that when Pikemen were abolished,
soon after 1700, there existed only one sort of
Infantry, although certain Regiments and Companies
were termed Grenadiers and Fusiliers.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Light Infantry and Rifles</span></h3>

<p>But after all these changes the need of Light
Infantry in war remained none the less urgent, and
again special troops began to be formed for Light
Infantry duties. Thus, Infantry, which had just
been reduced to one type, once more differentiated
during the eighteenth century into two kinds—ordinary
and light Infantry.</p>

<p>The process began during the Seven Years’ War
about the middle of the eighteenth century. The
Austrian Light Infantry, called <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Freischarren</i>, or
“free hordes,” irregular troops formed from the
less civilized races in the army, caused the
Prussians constant annoyance. This led Frederick
the Great to copy the idea, by collecting Austrian
deserters, and smugglers and wilder spirits from
among his own people, to form Light Infantry. He
also raised from foresters and gamekeepers special
troops called <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Jägers</i>, literally “huntsmen,” who
were armed with the more accurate rifled musket
used for sport, and were well fitted for sharp-shooting.
The French followed suit, and in 1759
formed Corps of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Chasseurs</i> (the equivalent word to
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Jägers</i>), and in 1805 raised light troops of small
men, called <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Voltigeurs</i>—that is, “men who can turn
quickly,” from their agility. The British, too, began
to form Light Infantry out of their newly raised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
Highland Corps about the middle of the eighteenth
century. Later, in consequence of British experiences
in America with the backwoodsmen—good
shots using rifles—special Battalions of Rifles,
like those of France and Prussia, were raised before
the end of the century.</p>

<p>These various descriptions of light troops in
all armies were sharp-shooters, armed with rifles,
and accustomed to independent action at the front.
Their development followed two separate lines.
The Light Troops were attached to each Battalion
in the form of a <em>Light Infantry Company</em>, or sometimes
grouped in special Battalions styled <em>Light
Infantry</em>, a title they still keep. The riflemen
formed the Battalions of <em>Rifles</em>, which still exist
in all armies under various names, but clothed
generally in the green uniform which German
gamekeepers still wear. Green was the customary
dress of a forester, as we are reminded by the
common sign for a country inn—“The Green
Man.” The addition of one or two Light Infantry
Companies, and sometimes of a Grenadier
Company, raised the number of Companies in
a Battalion to ten in England, five in Prussia,
and six in France, during the late eighteenth
century. Napoleon’s Battalions had six Companies,
as had all armies on the Continent (except the
Prussian) up to 1866, after which the Prussian
organization, with four, was introduced, and still
rules. French Chasseur Battalions (Rifles) have
retained six companies, as a more supple and
mobile organization for their special duties.</p>

<p>The Light Infantry Companies were much used<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
during the Napoleonic wars, but were soon afterwards
abolished. The Rifle Battalions gradually
lost their special character as Light Troops, while
retaining their uniforms and designations, and are
at present armed, trained, and used exactly like
ordinary Infantry, which has, however, adopted their
rifle and their extended formation in battle.</p>

<p>The tactical work of Light Infantry may perhaps
be said to be now done by Mounted Infantry, and
it may be asked whether the Rifle Regiments of
the British Army might not have taken up the
duties of Mounted Infantry, for which they seem
suited by their origin as picked troops, and their
Peninsular reputation and regimental traditions
of mobility and independent action. In Germany
a similar suggestion has been recently made to
provide Rifle Battalions with cycles, and send them
out to the front with the Cavalry—in fact, to turn
them virtually into “Mounted Infantry” on cycles.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE EVOLUTION OF CAVALRY</span></h2>
</div>

<p id="hdr_94">Modern Cavalry has perhaps but slight claim to
be descended from feudal Chivalry. The Man-at-Arms,
the fully armoured Knight, with his mounted
retinue of a squire, a page, and a few retainers,
acted indeed by “shock,” but <em>individually</em>, with
jealous independence of his fellow knights; whereas
the efficiency of Cavalry action has from the first
rested on a combined disciplined attack. But the
traditions of Chivalry may be traced in the “Cavalry
Spirit,” which preaches, like Danton, “de l’audace,
encore de l’audace, et toujours de l’audace,” and in
the prestige which still clings to the Mounted
Arm. Cavalry has never forgotten its aristocratic
and romantic ancestry, and is inclined to look down
somewhat on the Infantry without whom battles
cannot be fought, and still less won. Cavalry
is to this day the premier Arm in the British
and in many other Armies. In Germany the
logical insight of the Hohenzollerns has long
since made Infantry the senior Arm of the Service.</p>

<p>The word <em>Cavalry</em>—French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Cavallerie</i>, Italian
<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Cavaleria</i>—is, like <em>Chivalry</em>, derived from the Late<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
Latin word <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">caballus</i>, in common use for horse
when <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">equus</i> had become highflown. But <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">caballus</i>
became <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cheval</i> in Early French, whence <em>Chivalry</em>;
while the Italian <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Cavaleria</i> was directly derived
from <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">caballus</i>. The Knight’s arms, the sword and
lance, are still those of Cavalry, and his armour
survives in the metal helmet and cuirass.</p>

<p>The introduction of pikes and firearms for
Infantry was the cause of the extinction of the
man-at-arms, although he met them by himself
adopting a firearm for use on horseback. This was
at first the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">petronel</i>, or <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poitrinal</i>, fired from the
breast (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poitrine</i>) on a rest rising from the saddle
bow; then the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">harquebus</i>, or match lock fired
from the shoulder; later the <em>pistol</em>, a shorter and
lighter weapon, used with one hand, which was introduced
in Spain in 1520, and in Germany in 1540.
But by 1500 fire action had attained superiority
over shock action, and the mounted men in armour
became definitely inferior to the Infantry, whose
bullets pierced their armour, and whose pikes they
could seldom break through. Armour was reduced
to helmet and cuirass, and the lance given up,
not to be revived till two centuries later.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_95"><span class="smcap">Origin of true Cavalry in the “Reiters”</span></h3>

<p>We first find true Cavalry of the modern
type in the German “Reiters” of the early
sixteenth century, who were disciplined troopers,
acting in rank and file in organized bodies, as
distinguished from the individual man-at-arms of
feudal days. The organization of the Reiters
is practically the same as that of the infantry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
Landsknechts already described. They were similarly
raised by their Captains, in bodies termed
<em>Troops</em>, a name which was soon replaced by a tactical
unit composed of several Troops, which arose from
the tactical requirements of the battlefield. This was
the <em>Squadron</em>, a word derived from <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">squadra</i>, Italian
for <em>square</em>, because the earliest bodies of horsemen
had equal front and depth. The numbers in a
Troop depended on the popularity of the Captain;
but Squadrons were of a strength based on the fact
that one man could command by voice a body
of Cavalry with a front of 50 men. Thus the
“Reiter” Squadrons with six ranks were 300
strong, but those of Gustavus, with three ranks,
had 150 men. This is still the strength of a
Squadron to-day.</p>

<p>The Officers of the Troops of Reiters were the
<em>Captain</em>, still called <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Rittmeister</i> (or “<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Reiter</i>”-<em>master</em>)
in Germany to-day; the <em>Lieutenant</em>; the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Fähnrich</i>
(or <em>Colour-bearer</em>); the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Wachmeister</i> (or <em>Watch-master</em>),
as the Sergeant-Major is still called; the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Fourier</i> (or <em>Quarter-Master</em>), charged with allotting
quarters and subsistence, and also with reconnaissance,
as explained on page <a href="#Page_174">174</a>. He had an
assistant, answering to our Q.M.S. Each Troop
had a <em>Trumpeter</em>. He accompanied the Colour-bearer,
whose hornshaped pennon (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Cornette</i> in
French) gave its name to the officer carrying it,
known as “Cornet” down to our day.</p>

<p id="hdr_96">The Reiters carried sword and pistol, and wore
helmet and cuirass. They were the ancestors of
all Heavy Cavalry, generally called <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Cuirassiers</i>
abroad, but simply “Regiments of Horse” in England<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
There were always less regular Cavalry, or
<em>Light Horse</em>, for scouting, pursuit, and independent
action to front and flanks. This division of duties
and names has long survived.</p>

<p>To obtain better fire effect, Henry IV. of France
armed his Horse with a short arquebus called a
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">carabine</i>, whence the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Carbineers</i>. In Italy a
larger firearm, called a <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">dragon</i>, was given to horsemen,
so as to enable them to use fire with more
effect when dismounted. Hence originated <em>Dragoons</em>,
originally merely Mounted Infantry. We
have thus got the three Arms of the Service, as
commemorated in the old expression <em>Horse</em>, <em>Foot</em>,
and <em>Dragoons</em>, to denote the whole Army; for
Artillery did not become an Arm before 1700.</p>

<p id="hdr_97">Towards the end of the sixteenth century, under
Maurice of Nassau, the organization of the Dutch
Cavalry was further developed during the War of
Independence against Spain. His Squadrons were
fixed at 120 strong, with the three Officers and the
Trumpeter of the Reiters, but were now divided
into three Sections, each under an Officer, with a
Corporal. These represent the existing <em>Troops</em>.
A Farrier was added to the troop for shoeing and
veterinary work. Improved drill and discipline
enabled Maurice to reduce the ten ranks of his day
to six.</p>

<p>Gustavus organized the Swedish Army on the
same lines as Maurice, but improved on his model
in Cavalry, as in other Arms. His Troops were
smaller, only 70 strong, and were grouped in
Regiments of 8 troops. He was the first to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
inculcate <em>shock</em> tactics, which he facilitated by
reducing the ranks to four, and discouraging firing
from horseback.</p>

<p>After Gustavus’ brilliant success in the Thirty
Years’ War, the use of shock tactics was carried on
in England, but was not imitated in other countries.
Cromwell, seizing on the idea with his unfailing
military insight, taught his Ironsides to charge
home, and especially to rally after the charge. He
established an undying reputation as the first great
Cavalry leader in the modern sense, and his horsemen
were never equalled till Seidlitz appeared and
led Frederick’s Cavalry in the Seven Years’ War a
century later. Neither of these two great soldiers
has ever been surpassed, or indeed approached, as
a leader of Cavalry.</p>

<p>During those hundred years Cavalry continued
to fire from their horses, and charge at the trot.
Even long afterwards, Napoleon’s Heavy Cavalry
did not gallop. But Cavalry began to find their
true mode of action when Marlborough and
Charles XII. of Sweden expected their Horse to
charge without firing.</p>

<p>Frederick the Great, however, was the first to
initiate true Cavalry Tactics. He forbade any
firing from horseback, formed his Cavalry in two
ranks, and trained them to charge boot to boot in
long lines of scores of Squadrons. He insisted on
high speed over long distances, and adopted the
plan of charging in three lines—the first of Cuirassiers,
the second of Dragoons as a support, and the
third in columns to protect the flank. The training
and tactics of Frederick’s Cavalry have never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
been improved on, and are still the model for
shock action. Frederick’s Cavalry was organized,
like that of Gustavus, in Troops of 70 men, of
which two, or, later, four smaller ones as in Europe
to-day, formed a Squadron. The Regiment had 5
Squadrons, as it still has in Germany, although the
fifth now becomes the depôt of the Regiment
on mobilization.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_98"><span class="smcap">Light Horse</span></h3>

<p>During the Seven Years’ War, Austria made
good use of a screen of <em>light troops</em>, both Horse
and Foot, in front of her armies. Her Light
Horsemen had been very serviceable in the Thirty
Years’ War in the previous century, and had been
constantly used since in fighting the Turks.
These horsemen were irregular troops from
Hungary, where they had been raised since the
sixteenth century under the name of <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Hussars</i>.
They wore the national dress of Hungary, which
Hussars have retained ever since they were
imitated by Frederick during the Seven Years’
War, and in other armies later. <em>Lancers</em> were
similarly copied everywhere from the Polish Light
Cavalry, clothed in their national costume, who
joined Napoleon’s service in 1807. The lance,
which had not been used since the early sixteenth
century, was then reintroduced, and has since held
its own, and even won ground in Germany. The
British adopted Lancers after their experience
against Napoleon’s Polish Lancers at Waterloo.
The Prussians called them <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Ulans</i>, from the Polish,
while other nations adopted the French word<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Lancier</i>, from the Late Latin <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">lancearius</i> (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">lancea</i>,
a <em>lance</em>).</p>

<p>British Light Cavalry began in the eighteenth
century, in the Light Troops of the Dragoon Regiments,
soon detached to be grouped into Light
Dragoon Regiments, which, early in the nineteenth
century, were changed to Hussars.</p>

<p>After firing on horseback had been stopped by
Frederick, Cavalry discarded the firearm until the
close of the century, when the French Light
Horse of the Revolutionary armies received a short
musket, called by its old name of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">carbine</i>, which
became the universal Cavalry firearm for use on
foot. But Heavy Cavalry had no firearms for years;
even in the Prussian Army of 1870 only Light
Cavalry were armed with the carbine.</p>

<p id="hdr_99">Cavalry Regiments were first brigaded during
the eighteenth century, but had no higher organization.
The Brigade formed one of the lines of
Cavalry on each wing of the Army. Cavalry
Divisions were first formed by Hoche in 1793, and
were adopted by Napoleon, who extended the idea
later to creating Cavalry Corps of two or more
Divisions.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE EVOLUTION OF ARTILLERY AND ENGINEERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The early history of the Engineers and the Artillery
in England may be traced in the continued
existence, from the Conqueror to Henry VIII., of
a high official called in Latin documents the King’s
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ingeniator</i>, because he had charge of <em>Engines</em>
of War (Latin <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ingenium</i>). About 1300 the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ingeniator</i>
(or <em>Engyneor</em>, as he was called in English,
from the Old French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Engineur</i>) became styled
<em>Attilator</em> (probably a slovenly rendering of <em>Artillator</em>),
from the fact that, having charge of the
engines of war, he naturally took over the latest
form of them, the new invention of <em>artillery</em>. This
word is derived from the French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">artillerie</i>, which
meant the art of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">artilleur</i>, or <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">articulier</i>,
from <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">articularius</i>, or the man who handled <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">articula</i>,
the <em>articles</em> or the “<em>things</em>,” as the newly
invented guns began by being styled, that word
being a diminutive of <em>art-em</em>, <em>art</em>.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_100"><span class="smcap">The Artillery</span></h3>

<p>The word <em>artillery</em> meant in the sixteenth
century the guns used by the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">artilleur</i>, but did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
not denote the Arm of the Service till the end
of the next century, before which time Artillery
had hardly an independent existence, but formed
merely a portion of the train, or mass of vehicles
which followed an army.</p>

<h4 id="hdr_101">GUNS</h4>

<p>Cannon were at first used in fortresses during
the fifteenth century, soon after the invention
of gunpowder. They were soon mounted on
wheels, and then provided with trunnions and
a trail. They seem to have been first brought
into the field by the Hussites in Bohemia, and
then in the French invasion of Italy in 1496. The
French added the limber to carry the trail on
the march, and thus finally gave guns the form
they still have. In the mid-sixteenth century the
armies of three great monarchs, the Emperor
Charles V., Francis I. of France, and Henry VIII.
of England, possessed a train of cannon for the field.</p>

<p>At this epoch there were many descriptions of
mobile guns of various calibres: the heavy, 42-
and 24-pounders, for siege purposes chiefly, were
drawn by several yoke of oxen; the lighter ones,
for use in the field, fired 2, 4, or 6 pound shot,
and were drawn by horses in single file. The
drivers, till the end of the eighteenth century,
walked on foot beside their horses, carrying carters’
whips, and were civilians, hired with their teams
from the country. To keep them from running
away, the train of guns and wagons carrying
ammunition were under an escort of Infantry,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
who were only much later used for protection of
the guns.</p>

<p>The working of the gun, and its technical mysteries,
were in the hands of the <em>Master Gunner</em>,
with his <em>Gunner</em> and two assistants for each gun.
In England these gentry were apart from the
army, and solely controlled by the <em>Master-General
of the Ordnance</em>, as the Artillery and the nearly
related Engineers remained down to our own time.</p>

<p id="hdr_102">Maurice, about 1600, did away with the great
variety of guns which existed, and retained four
different calibres only, so as to facilitate the supply
of shot. Gustavus, a little later, introduced lighter
guns, and cartridges for the powder, which till then
had been carried loose in barrels. But his main
innovation was the allotment of two light guns to
each Infantry Battalion, for action in the intervals
between Regiments, an organization retained in
most armies till the end of the eighteenth century.
These “Battalion guns” were drawn by one or
two horses, or by men when under fire, and were
often served by the Infantry they were attached
to. He used the heavier guns in masses on the
wings and in the centre; but no Battery organization
came in till late in the eighteenth century.
In France, under Louis XIV., the step was taken
of creating a Regiment of Artillery, formed of
Gunners and Artificers, the Drivers being still
hired. This idea was partially copied in England,
where the Artillery was organized into a Military
Corps in 1716. Other armies formed Companies
of Artillery, but had no Regimental organization
till much later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
Shells were first used in the field about 1700,
they fired from what were called <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Hautbitzers</i>, now
<em>Howitzers</em>, a Czech word taken from Zisca’s
organization of the Hussite hosts in Bohemia long
before. Grapeshot was also invented; but solid
shot was the projectile of Artillery down to the
introduction of General Shrapnel’s shell in the
British Artillery about 1810, followed much
later by the universal adoption of shell fire for
field guns. Another invention, Congreve’s rocket,
was partially adopted in the English service before
the battle of Waterloo.</p>

<p id="hdr_103">In the middle of the eighteenth century
Frederick the Great made considerable progress
in Artillery organization, although the material
was unchanged. He increased the number of
guns till he had 5 or 6 to every 1,000 Infantry,
which is to-day the proportion thought desirable.
In 1759 he formed a light Battery with gunners
mounted, so as to keep up with Cavalry. <span  id="hdr_104">This
Horse Artillery</span> was eventually adopted by the
Austrians in 1783, and by the French and British
in the Revolutionary Wars. Frederick abolished
Battalion Guns, and grouped them in permanent
Batteries, the germ of modern <em>Field Batteries</em>,
although drivers were not mounted, or made into
soldiers, till near the end of the century. The
heavier guns were still dragged by horses in single
file, led by civilian drivers on foot, and were called
“Guns of position.” They were generally formed
in four masses—centre, wings, and reserve. After
the Seven Years’ War these guns were everywhere
formed into <em>Batteries</em> of uniform calibre, which in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
France were called <i id="hdr_105">Divisions</i>, and manned by
one Company of the Artillery Regiment. The
teams began to be harnessed in pairs, with the
drivers mounted on the near horse. The modern
battery system was thus introduced, and may be
said to have been adopted in every army towards
the end of the eighteenth century, when battalion
guns were abolished. Batteries began to be
brigaded by threes or fours during the early part
of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>In England and France, about 1800, a corps
of drivers for Artillery was formed, in which for
the first time drivers had uniform and discipline;
but these corps were abolished after 1820, and
the drivers became an integral part of the
Artillery.</p>

<p>In Austria and Prussia, Batteries were allotted
to <em>Infantry Brigades</em>, a system which was kept
up in Prussia till after Waterloo, and in Austria
till after the war of 1866. In France, during the
Revolutionary Wars, the Batteries were allotted
to <em>Divisions</em>, in the way which still holds. There
was always, in addition, a mass of guns styled
the <em>Reserve Artillery</em>, which we find during the
Napoleonic Wars, and down to the campaign of
1870. By that time it had been converted in the
Prussian Army into <em>Corps Artillery</em>, an arrangement
which all other armies have since copied.
About 1900, however, the Corps Artillery was
abolished in Germany, and its batteries distributed
to the Divisions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_106"><span class="smcap">The Evolution of the Engineers</span></h3>

<p>The name and calling of the Engineer is traceable
through English history in the existence of
the King’s <em>Engynour</em>, as mentioned at the commencement
of this chapter. He had charge of
what we now call Engineer Works, as well as of
the Artillery. Both these Services were, up to the
Stuart times, mainly connected with fortresses and
sieges; but the first and the third King Edwards
had with their field armies a corps of <em>Military
Artificers</em>, and Henry VIII. formed a body of
<em>Pioneers</em> for work in the field. These were
artisans, either specially recruited, or taken from
the ranks of the Infantry, as Pioneers still are. The
body was commanded by a Captain of Pioneers,
who was practically an Engineer Officer. He and
his men formed part of the field force, and were
Field Engineers.</p>

<p>From this time onwards, the Pioneers are
identified with the field operations of an army,
while individual Engineer Officers were attached
to the Staff. The latter were formed into the
Corps of Royal Engineers in 1772. This system,
which differentiated between Pioneer men commanded
by Engineer Officers, and individual
Engineer Officers on the Staff, is exactly that
which still exists in the German Army.</p>

<p>A Corps of Military Artificers was formed in
1770, and became the <em>Corps of Sappers and
Miners</em> in 1780. It was constantly used in the
field, especially in the sieges in the Peninsula and
in the Crimea, after which it became merged with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
the Engineer Officers into the Corps of Royal
Engineers.</p>

<p>The developments of science applied to war,
such as railways, telegraphs, and balloons, the
importance of mobility for modern armies, which
entails much road-making and bridging work, and
the increased demand for field works in the attack,
as well as on the defensive, have greatly increased
the demand for Engineers with Forces in the field.</p>

<p>It may be pointed out that the Military Engineer
existed for centuries before the <em>civil engineer</em>,
who is a nineteenth-century offshoot of his military
colleague, named after him, and not vice versa, as
is sometimes imagined. The <em>civil engineer</em> was so
called because, like the Engineer, he dealt with
tools, machinery, and works, but only for civil
purposes.</p>

<span class="subhead">ORGANIZATION IN THE SEVENTEENTH AND
EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 id="hdr_107"><span class="smcap">The “New Model” Army</span></h3>

<p>The Swedish Army under Gustavus proved so
effective and successful in the Thirty Years’ War
that it became the model for the organization
common to all armies during the seventeenth
century, which may be well studied by British
soldiers in the “New Model” Army, raised in the
Civil War on Cromwell’s suggestion. This army,
perhaps the best disciplined and most effective the
world has ever seen since Roman times, was never
beaten during its many campaigns. The “New
Model” is the true ancestor of the British Army,
which has proved itself not unworthy of its
descent. We still wear the red coat common in
Cromwell’s army, and have its organization and
military terms in use to-day. Marlborough’s army
was practically the same as the New Model Army,
only with bayonets for pikes, and flint locks for
match locks.</p>

<p>The New Model Army was organized much like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
the armies of Maurice and Gustavus. It was
composed as follows:</p>

<p>The Horse were formed in 11 Regiments of
600 men each, with 6 Troops. The Foot were
in 12 Regiments of 1,200 men, each with 10 Companies.
The Dragoons, which were practically
Mounted Infantry, formed one Regiment of 1,000,
in 10 Companies. Regiments had been formed
in England after 1618. The Colonel had a Company
of his own, and, as he could not command it
himself as well as the Regiment, it was commanded
by the Lieutenant, who was therefore
styled <em>Lieutenant of the Colonel</em>, or Lieutenant-Colonel.
That officer’s connection with the
Commanding Officer caused him to be of such
importance that his position was that of Second-in-Command
of the Regiment, and he eventually
became the Commanding Officer, as he is to-day.
In the Horse, the Colonel had, similarly, a Troop,
which was commanded by the Lieutenant, who
ranked as Junior Captain, and was called <em>Captain-Lieutenant</em>.
Horse Regiments had thus no
Lieutenant-Colonel, and Cavalry Regiments have
no Second-in-Command in any army to-day.</p>

<p>All Regiments had a <em>Major</em> (originally the
<em>Sergeant-Major</em>), whose duties were those of our
Adjutant. The latter officer was introduced
after the Restoration in 1660, to perform the
duties of the Major, who had become Second-in-Command,
owing to the Lieutenant-Colonel having
become Commanding Officer. Like the Colonel,
the Lieutenant-Colonel and Major had each a
Company of their own to provide their emoluments,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>
and these were stronger than those of
ordinary Captains, so as to bring in more pay to
the senior officers.</p>

<p>Each Regiment had a <em>Provost-Marshal</em> to enforce
discipline, a <em>Surgeon</em>, and a <em>Chaplain</em>, and
Infantry had a <em>Quarter-Master</em> and a <em>Drum-Major</em>.</p>

<p>The Troops of Cavalry had four Officers—<em>Captain</em>,
<em>Lieutenant</em>, <em>Cornet</em>, <em>Quarter-Master</em>—and
three <em>Corporals</em> and three <em>Trumpeters</em>. There
were no Sergeants of Horse, so that even to-day in
the Household Cavalry the word Corporal-Major is
used instead of Sergeant-Major.</p>

<p>The Infantry Companies had three Officers—<em>Captain</em>,
<em>Lieutenant</em>, <em>Ensign</em>—and two <em>Sergeants</em>,
three <em>Corporals</em>, a <em>Quarter-Master-Sergeant</em>, and
two <em>Drummers</em>.</p>

<p>The Artillery was at this time of little account.
The lighter guns—3- to 6-pounders—were
attached in pairs to each Regiment, like our
Machine Guns to-day. This practice survived
during the eighteenth century. The heavier
guns—9- to 12-pounders—with a few larger
ones up to 20-pounders, were drawn by teams
of horses or oxen, driven by civilians on foot.
They formed, with the wagons carrying ammunition
both for guns and match locks, the <em>Train</em>,
controlled by the <em>Waggon-Master-General</em>. Each
gun was served by a <em>Master Gunner</em> and two
<em>Under-Cannoneers</em>, while the train was managed
by <em>Waggon-Masters</em>, assisted by <em>Furriers</em> (French
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Fouriers</i>) and clerks, and a number of artificers of
all sorts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
The Head-Quarters of the Army consisted of
a <em>General</em> as C.-in-C., with a Second-in-Command,
naturally called the <em>Lieutenant-General</em>,
who commanded the principal Arm—the Cavalry.
There was a <em>Sergeant-Major-General</em> who commanded
the Infantry, and was, as his name implies,
the Chief Staff Officer of the Commander-in-Chief,
as the Sergeant-Major was the Staff Officer
of the Colonel of a Regiment. In these titles the
Sergeant has long been dropped, and the (<em>Sergeant</em>)
<em>Major-General</em> is still, as in the “New Model,”
the junior rank of General Officer. A <em>Master-General
of the Ordnance</em> controlled the Artillery,
Engineers, and Train.</p>

<p>The two Generals of Horse and Foot had each
a Staff, consisting of an <em>Adjutant-General</em> and
a <em>Quarter-Master-General</em>. Under the <em>Master of
the Ordnance</em> there were a <em>Comptroller of the
Ordnance</em>, and an <em>Engineer-General</em> with several
assistant Engineers, but no men.</p>

<p>The list of Administrative Officers on the Head-Quarters
Staff is interesting, as showing the
antiquity of many of our military titles:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>The Judge-Advocate-General.</p>

<p>Two Provost-Marshals-General—one for the Horse, one for the Foot.</p>

<p>The Commissary-General of Victuals.</p>

<p>The Commissary-General of Horse Provisions.</p>

<p>The Waggon-Master-General, in charge of Train and baggage.</p>

<p>Medical Officers.</p>

<p>The Chaplain to the Army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>
Two Treasurers-at-War (or Paymasters).</p>

<p>The Muster-Master-General.</p>

<p>The Scout-Master-General, who was what we
should call the Chief Intelligence Officer;
he had two Assistants and twenty Scouts.</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="hdr_108"><span class="smcap">The Armies of the Eighteenth Century</span></h3>

<p>Throughout the greater part of the eighteenth
century the Armies of Europe much resembled
those of the seventeenth, of which the “New
Model,” just described, is an example. They were
formed of a number of Regiments of Cavalry, and
separate Battalions, or at most Brigades, of Infantry,
accompanied by a long train of guns and
motley wagons carrying food and baggage. These
were drawn by teams of oxen and horses hired in
the country, driven by wagoners on foot.</p>

<p>There was no grouping of the units of the army
into larger organizations, except on the battlefield,
when fractions of the battle array were sometimes
temporarily placed under a named Commander.
The whole army marched, camped, and fought as
one body, covering but little ground compared
with the armies of to-day, owing to its smaller
numbers. It was thus always under the eye of the
Commander, whether on the march, in camp, or in
battle.</p>

<p>The march columns were shortened, when possible,
by moving the Infantry in column of sections
down the broader roads, or even in battalion column
across the open fields alongside. At night, to
prevent desertion and marauding, billets were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span>
never used, and bivouacs seldom, but the army lay
concentrated in a formal camp in order of battle, so
that it could, without delay, form up in front of the
camp ready for the combat.</p>

<p>In battle, the disposition of the army was in
two lines of Infantry, among which some of the
lighter guns were dispersed in pairs, while the
heavier ones were massed on the wings and at
the centre. The Cavalry were on each flank.
The wagon train was parked in rear under a
strong escort for its protection against marauding
cavalry. The marshalling of the army in due
precedence of each unit, and placing the army in
correct position without overlapping or crooked
lines, was a delicate process, which would often take
hours to perform.</p>

<p>Whether in camp, or in battle, each of the
Regiments was separate and unconnected, and each
received its Orders direct from the Commander,
who himself personally watched their execution.
He thus <em>commanded</em> in the strictest sense, and
needed little assistance from his Staff Officers, who
were chiefly used to gallop to the troops with his
Orders.</p>

<p>The above gives a picture of the earliest regular
armies in Europe, such as those commanded by
Gustavus Adolphus, Turenne, Marlborough, and
Frederick the Great. The latter, however, introduced,
during his long wars, several improvements
in his army, which became, during the Seven Years’
War, the model of Europe owing to its extraordinary
success, opposed though it was to the
larger but inferior armies of Austria, Russia, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
France. Some of the details of Frederick’s organization
have been mentioned in previous pages
dealing with each Arm.</p>

<p>Frederick himself generally acted against the two
first-mentioned enemies, and detached a very able
General, Ferdinand of Brunswick, to oppose the
French. Ferdinand had under his command an
allied force, formed of small separate armies of all
Arms, provided by Prussia, Britain, Holland, Brunswick,
and Hesse. These remained under their
own Commanders, and were virtually what were
later known as <em>Divisions</em>.</p>

<p>In Frederick’s army the only trace of higher
organization is found in his dividing the whole for
battle into two Wings and a body of Cavalry, and
allotting separate Commanders to each portion. In
this, we perhaps find the germ of the Army Corps
system adopted in the next century.</p>

<h4>UNIFORM</h4>

<p>Uniform, or clothing of a uniform pattern, was
not customary till the middle of the seventeenth
century. It had been seen in the red coats of
selected troops which Henry VIII. brought in;
but the historic red coat was first given to the
whole army by Cromwell, and continued after
the Restoration. Uniform was brought in by
Louis XIV. later, and its use spread everywhere.
Gustavus had distinguished his Brigades by coloured
scarves. The English, fighting for Protestantism
in aid of the Netherlands against Spain, wore
Orange and Blue scarves, whence perhaps the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
adoption of one or other of these colours to represent
the Whig in English politics in the eighteenth
century. Cromwell’s army wore an Orange scarf,
whence no doubt came the hue of Protestant
Ireland, which was to a great extent settled by his
parliamentary soldiers.</p>

<h4>MILITARY MUSIC</h4>

<p>Music had long been used by soldiers, and was
encouraged by Henry VIII.; but marching in step
to fife and drum was invented by the Swiss in
the fourteenth century, copied in the fifteenth by
the Landsknechts, and from them adopted in all
armies. It is interesting to note that the roll on
the drum always heard before the band begins a
march is the old Landsknechts’ drum march.</p>

<h4>FLAGS OR COLOURS</h4>

<p>Flags were probably derived from the Knights’
Banner. They were used as Standards by the
Swiss, from whom the Reiters and Landsknechts
copied the custom, which was then universally
adopted. Their varied hues caused them to be
styled <em>Colours</em> in England during the reign of
Elizabeth. The flag was used not only to distinguish
the combatant sides, but also the different
regiments, and the men were taught to close and
rally to it, and to associate with it ideals of duty
and self-sacrifice which still cling to the Colours
to-day.</p>

<p>The flag was carried on a time-honoured system
which became an art. The various ways of waving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span>
and folding it were originally signals for movements
which the musicians looked to for guidance,
so that the flag-bearer in a sense led the music.
The traditions and coquetries of this art were
gradually lost, and only survive in the pride of
the drum-major in the play of his staff, as he
leads the drums at the head of the regiment.</p>

<span class="subhead">ORGANIZATION IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 id="hdr_109"><span class="smcap">Organization in the Wars following the
French Revolution</span></h3>

<p>At the close of the eighteenth century, during
the wars brought on by the French Revolution, a
great change in organization took place. France,
with her old army shattered by the Revolution,
was suddenly obliged to raise enormous numbers of
troops to defend herself against the onslaught of
Europe. When, with unparalleled courage and
energy, she had stemmed the flood of invasion, a
number of French armies at once took the offensive,
and carried the war beyond her frontiers in
every direction for the next twenty years.</p>

<h4 id="hdr_110">DIVISIONS</h4>

<p>The size of the armies, and the area covered by
them, made it impossible for the Commander to
exercise personal control over his whole force,
especially as the absence of a system of supply
entailed wide dispersion for subsistence on the
country invaded. It became necessary to appoint
independent Generals to command the scattered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
fractions of the Army, often operating at a distance
from each other. This arrangement was instituted
by Carnot in the early wars of the Revolution.</p>

<p>It thus came about that the Army was <em>divided</em>
into separate portions, which were naturally termed
its <em>Divisions</em>, a designation which was retained
when they became permanent organizations, and
exists in all armies to this day.</p>

<p>These <em>Divisions</em> consisted mainly of Infantry,
but some Light Cavalry and Artillery were
attached to them, so as to make them capable of
the independent action demanded by the increased
extent of the theatre of war and of the battlefields.</p>

<p>The Division comprised generally 12 Battalions
of Infantry, 4 to 8 Squadrons, and 8 to 12 guns,
with the necessary administrative services, making
a total of some 10,000 to 12,000 in all, under
command of a General Officer.</p>

<p>The Infantry was formed in what were termed
<em>Demi-Brigades</em> of 3 Battalions, which reverted to
the name of <em>Regiments</em> in 1803. These comprised
one Battalion of regulars from the old Royal Army,
and two of Volunteers. Each Battalion had 9
Companies, each about 120 strong; one being of
Grenadiers, and two of Light Infantry. The
Battalions were numbered, their old army name
being dropped. The Cavalry Regiments were of
4 Squadrons, each 150 to 200 strong. The practice
of living on the country allowed the transport train
to be greatly reduced, especially as tents were discarded,
and the troops always bivouacked, when
not billeted. Company officers were allowed no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
bât animals for their baggage. By these measures
the mobility of the army was greatly increased.</p>

<p>This divisional organization was adopted by
Austria in 1805, by Prussia in 1806, and by Russia
in 1807; we find it in the British Army in the
Peninsula in 1808, when the Divisions were formed
of 2 Brigades of 3 or 4 Battalions each, with
1 or 2 Batteries, and often a Rifle Battalion.</p>

<h4>CORPS D’ARMÉE (ARMY CORPS)</h4>

<p>The power of independent action thus conferred
on these Divisions, which were in fact miniature
armies, led to a want of concert in their movements,
and of co-ordination in their action, while at the
same time, as Armies increased in size, the number
of Divisions became too great for the Commander-in-Chief
to control properly.</p>

<p>An attempt to remedy these drawbacks was
made in 1800 by Moreau, when planning his invasion
of South Germany. He grouped his Divisions
into two Wings and a Centre, which he placed
under three senior Generals, while retaining a
Reserve of four Divisions in his own hand. Each
Division was either 5,000 or 10,000 strong, and 3
or 4 of them, with 6 guns per 5,000 men, and a
Cavalry Division of 2,000 or 3,000, formed virtually
a Corps d’Armée, 20,000 to 30,000 strong.</p>

<p>Bonaparte, when First Consul, grasping the
desirability of this arrangement for large armies,
introduced a permanent organization by Corps
d’Armée.</p>

<p>In this manner was organized the army assembled
at Boulogne, in 1804, for the invasion of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
England. This formed the famous “Grande
Armée,” which overcame Austria, Prussia, and
Russia in three great wars during the succeeding
three years, and formed the model of organization
for the later armies of France, and eventually for
those of all the great Powers of Europe.</p>

<p>The Napoleonic Army Corps was commanded
by a Lieutenant-General or a Marshal. Its size
depended on the capacity of its Commander, and
varied from 2 to 4 Divisions, each of 2 or 3 Brigades
of 2 Regiments of 3 Battalions. A Battalion
had 6 Companies, or sometimes 9, and was 700 to
1,000 strong. A Cavalry Regiment had 4 or 5
Squadrons, of 150 to 200 men.</p>

<h4 id="hdr_111">DETAILS OF NAPOLEON’S ORGANIZATION</h4>

<p>In 1805, light companies, or <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Voltigeurs</i>, were
added to Battalions for skirmishing duties, thus
relieving the Grenadier Companies from this work.
Napoleon then detached the latter from their
Battalions to form a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Grenadier Corps</i> as an Army
Reserve, to which all the Voltigeur companies
were afterwards added.</p>

<p>In 1808, in the first French army sent to Spain,
the Brigades were of 2 or sometimes 3 Regiments,
or 6,000 to 10,000 strong. The Companies had
become increased up to 140 men, but their
number was only six when the Grenadier and the
two Voltigeur Companies had been detached.</p>

<p>The Cavalry not allotted to Divisions of Infantry
was formed into Divisions of 2 or 3 Brigades, those
of Light Cavalry being attached to Army Corps,
while the Heavy Cavalry Divisions formed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
<em>Cavalry Reserve</em>. This was practically a Cavalry
Corps of 4 Divisions, with 2 Batteries of Horse
Artillery, or 20,000 in all. Its function was to enable
Napoleon to influence the battle by the decisive
effect of an overwhelming mass of Cavalry, as well
as to furnish a body of Cavalry under one command
for action well to the front of the Army during
its advance—in fact, to perform the duty of Independent
Cavalry of to-day.</p>

<p>The Artillery not allotted to Army Corps was
similarly formed into one body called the <em>Reserve
Artillery</em>, under Napoleon’s own Orders. This was
used in one mass against the centre of the enemy’s
line, where Napoleon intended to launch his main
attack.</p>

<p>He invariably kept the Reserve Army Corps,
as well as the Cavalry and Artillery Reserve, in his
own hands, for decisive action at the crucial
moment of the battle.</p>

<p>These Army Corps were soon imitated by
Prussia after 1806, by Austria before 1809, and by
Russia by 1812, and became the permanent organization
of the first two nations down to this day;
but it was not definitely adopted by Russia until
the close of the nineteenth century. In the Civil
War in the United States both sides adopted
Army Corps, which the size of their armies
rendered desirable.</p>

<h4 id="hdr_112">STRENGTH OF ARMY CORPS</h4>

<p>The strength of Napoleon’s Army Corps was
very variable. In the Grande Armée it was at first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
2 or 3 Divisions of 2 or 3 Brigades, with 1
Cavalry Division, or from 19,000 to 30,000 in all.
The Cavalry Corps was of 20,000 with 2 Horse
Artillery Batteries.</p>

<p>In later campaigns the Army Corps grew
larger, and their strength varied with the quality of
their Commander.</p>

<p>In 1809 they were of 30,000 to 40,000 men, and
one was of 4 Divisions with 60,000. In 1812
the French Corps varied from 30,000 to 70,000,
the largest having 5 Divisions; but the Corps
of the foreign allies were less than 25,000 strong.
There were four Cavalry Corps, each of 28
Squadrons of Light Cavalry, 16 of Cuirassiers,
and 16 of Dragoons. In 1813 the French
Corps varied from 20,000 to 50,000, and the Cavalry
Corps from 10,000 to 16,000. In 1815 the Corps
were from 16,000 to 24,000 strong, and the Cavalry
Corps was in 4 Divisions. Throughout these
campaigns most of the Army Corps had a Cavalry
Division attached to them.</p>

<p>Since Napoleon’s time the organization of the
French Army has been on similar lines.</p>

<p>In the war with Austria in 1859 the Army Corps
had 2 Divisions, each of 2 Brigades, or 18 to 20
Battalions, with 40 to 56 guns.</p>

<p>In 1870 the Army Corps were of 3 Divisions
with a Light Cavalry Division of 2 Brigades.
Those commanded by a Marshal had 4 Divisions
and a Cavalry Division of 4 Brigades. The
Artillery with each Division consisted of 3
Field Batteries and 1 of Mitrailleuses; the Corps
Artillery of 5 Batteries. As in Napoleon’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
armies, there were Reserve Divisions of Heavy
Cavalry, comprising 2 Brigades of 2 Regiments,
with 2 Batteries of Horse Artillery. One evil of
this organization was that the Light Cavalry
Divisions kept close to their Army Corps, and the
distant reconnoitring for the whole army fell to
the Reserve Heavy Divisions, which were unsuited
to this duty, and were often kept actually in
reserve.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_113"><span class="smcap">Prussian Organization in the Nineteenth
Century</span></h3>

<p>The Divisional organization was introduced just
before the campaign of Jena in 1806, when the
Division had 10 to 12 Battalions, 15 Squadrons,
and 24 to 30 guns. By 1813, in the War of
Liberation, Army Corps of 4 Brigades had replaced
the Division. The Brigade was a mixed
one of all Arms, and comprised 2 Regiments,
or 6 Battalions, and 1 Battalion of Grenadiers
formed by massing the Grenadier Companies of
the Battalions. There were allotted to the Brigades
3 Regiments of Cavalry and 2 Batteries of 8 guns
each.</p>

<p>In 1815, in the Waterloo campaign, we find
a similar organization, but the Brigades were of
3 Regiments, and dearth of Cavalry and Artillery
only allowed 2 Squadrons, and 1 Battery of 8 guns,
for each Brigade.</p>

<p>The mistake of the Prussian organization in the
Napoleonic Wars was that the whole of the
Cavalry and Artillery were split up among
the Brigades, and there was no body of either to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>
oppose the massed Horse and guns of Napoleon’s
Reserve, which he threw into action at the crucial
moment with overpowering effect. This error
was corrected, and after Waterloo the Army Corps
comprised 3 Divisions which represented the old
Brigades, and a Cavalry Division of 2 Brigades
of 2 Regiments each, with 2 Horse Artillery
Batteries. In 1853 the Army Corps was organized
in its modern shape in 2 Divisions, of 2 Brigades,
of 2 Regiments, with 1 Cavalry Regiment; but
it had only 4 Batteries, or 32 guns, with each
Division, and no Corps Artillery.</p>

<p>In 1860 the Field Batteries, which had until
then 8 guns, were reduced to their present strength
of 6 guns.</p>

<p>The experience gained in 1866 caused considerable
modification in organization to be made before the
war of 1870 broke out. The Reserve Artillery
was abolished, and divided among the Army
Corps, thus forming “Corps Artillery” of 7
Batteries. The 5th Squadron of Cavalry was made
into a depôt, and Regiments took the field in 1870
with 4 Squadrons only, as at present. The
Reserve Cavalry was abolished, and Cavalry Divisions
formed. These were attached, not to Army
Corps as in France, but to Armies, being intended
for reconnaissance far to the front.</p>

<p>Of recent years the Corps Artillery has been
abolished, and the Batteries comprising it are
distributed among the two Divisions, so as to
increase the co-operation of the Artillery with the
Infantry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_114"><span class="smcap">Proportions of the Arms</span></h3>

<h4>CAVALRY AND INFANTRY</h4>

<p>In the sixteenth century the Horse outnumbered
the Foot, but in the Thirty Years’ War they were
roughly equal. In the English Civil War, and
later in the seventeenth century, the Infantry
began to outnumber the Cavalry, and in the
eighteenth century the proportion of Foot to
Horse rose, till it was in the proportion of 3, or
even 4 to 1, and in the Napoleonic Wars, of
6 or 8 to 1.</p>

<p>In the nineteenth century, when armies became
much larger, the proportion of Infantry to Cavalry
increased still more, owing to the expense of the
latter Arm, and the longer training it needed, till
in 1870 it was 10 to 1 in the French Army, and
13 to 1 in the German. It is still 13 to 1 in
the German Army, but only 16 to 1 in the
French.</p>

<h4>GUNS AND INFANTRY</h4>

<p>The number of guns was small till the close of
the seventeenth century; in the armies of Maurice it
was 1 gun to 1,000 Infantry, a proportion which Gustavus
raised considerably. In Marlborough’s army
it was over 3 per 1,000. The number of guns to
1,000 Infantry rose during the eighteenth century,
till it became 4 or even 5 in the later armies of
Frederick the Great; but it was only 3 or 4 in the
larger armies of the Napoleonic Wars. In 1866
there were 6 guns per 1,000 Infantry in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
Austrian Army, and 5 in the Prussian; in 1870, 3
to 4 guns in the German Army, and 3 in the
French. There are at present 6 guns per 1,000
Infantry in the German Army, and slightly more
in the British, but rather less in the other armies.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE EVOLUTION OF THE STAFF AND ADMINISTRATIVE
SERVICES</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 id="hdr_115">1. <span class="smcap">The Staff</span></h3>

<p>The origin of the Staff must be looked for in the
earliest European organization, that of the Reiters
and Landsknechts in Germany about <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1500, and
in the armies of Maurice and Gustavus modelled
on them. This organization was copied in England,
France, Prussia, and other military nations,
and survives in essentials to this day.</p>

<p>We find in the sixteenth century that the fighting
officers of the troop or company left the drill to
the Sergeant, an officer of experience in handling
troops, and a most important personage in the unit.
In action, while the other officers were in front,
fighting, the Sergeant was in rear correcting the
men’s movements, and giving orders. In the
Infantry he had to run up and down the ranks for
this purpose, and was therefore not armed with the
long pike, which would hamper him. The Sergeant
therefore either retained the halberd when Infantry
gave it up for the pike, or was armed with a half-pike.
These arms long survived in the British<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>
Army, where sergeants carried a halberd down to
1829, and the subalterns a half-pike or “spontoon,”
down to 1786.</p>

<p>Similar duties to those of the Sergeant in the
Company were performed in the Regiment by the
Sergeant-Major, who supervised the drilling of the
Companies by the Sergeants, regulated the march
of the Regiment and its manœuvres in battle, and
was therefore charged with the issue of orders.
He was thus virtually a Staff Officer to the Colonel.
Similarly, in an army, the Commander required an
officer of experience to draw up the army in line of
battle, a difficult task, and a delicate one, as the
precedence of each corps had to be respected.
This officer was called the Sergeant-Major-General,
as he filled for the Army the same functions as the
Sergeant-Major for the Regiment. He was the
Staff Officer of the Army, responsible for planning
the battle manœuvres, regulating marches, arranging
for the quartering of the troops, and necessarily,
therefore, for issuing the orders dealing with these
matters. The word <em>Sergeant</em> was soon dropped
from both these titles. The <em>Sergeant-Major</em>
became the <em>Major</em> of the Regiment, with the
duties of the modern <em>Adjutant</em>, and the <em>Sergeant-Major-General</em>
became the <em>Major-General</em> of the
Army.</p>

<p>We thus find in the sixteenth century that the
Staff work of the Army was performed by the
officer known in France as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">le Major-Général des
Logis</i>, or <em>Major-General of Quarters</em>, as the allotment
of quarters was one of his chief duties. It
may be mentioned that the old word for Staff<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
duties was <em>Logistics</em>, formed from the word <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Logis</i>,
and meant the duties of the Major-Général des
Logis. This title was then shortened to <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">le Major-Général</i>,
by which name the chief Staff officer
of the Army has been always called in France
down to this day.</p>

<p>The full word was translated <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Quartier-Meister-General</i>
in German, or <em>Quarter-Master-General</em>
in English, and this Staff Officer was charged with
the Staff duties of the Sergeant-Major-General—namely:
Orders, Drill, Manœuvres, Quarters.
But the necessity of preceding the army to allot
quarters for it entails deciding which road the army
is to march by, so the duty of reconnoitring the
roads, and thus that of reconnaissance generally,
was added to the list of the duties of the Q.M.G.
We thus find, in the eighteenth century, that what
are now the duties of the General Staff were
allotted to the <em>Quarter-Master-General</em> in the
British and Prussian Services, and to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Major-Général</i>
in the French.</p>

<p>These duties continued to be performed by the
Q.M.G. Staff in England, down to a few years ago.
In Prussia the Q.M.G. was the second officer to
Moltke on the General Staff in the war of 1870,
and the appointment was only abolished in 1888.</p>

<p>At the close of the seventeenth century another
Staff Officer was established at Head-Quarters by
the name of Adjutant-General, who was charged
with all questions relating to personnel, and with
routine duties, as distinguished from those connected
with movement, quartering, and fighting, which
were the duties of the Q.M.G. The A.G.’s Staff<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
is in all armies charged to-day with the same
duties as in the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>There were generally attached to the Staff some
Engineer Officers, who were charged with map-making
for military purposes. The maps of
European countries are therefore known as Staff
Maps, while that of Great Britain is called the
<em>Ordnance Survey</em>, because made by the Royal
Engineers, a Corps under the “Master-General of
the Ordnance.”</p>

<p id="hdr_116">The General Staff was created in Prussia in 1815,
in consequence of the experience gained in the
Napoleonic Wars. The then Q.M.G. Staff was
transformed into the General Staff, and placed
under the direct orders of the King. Some of the
General Staff Officers were attached to Army Corps
and Brigades (there were not yet any Divisions),
and the rest formed the Great General Staff at
Berlin. There has been but little change in this
organization of the Prussian General Staff, which,
it may be noted, acts for the whole military forces
of the German Empire, for there is no <em>German</em>
General Staff in the sense in which there is a
<em>German</em> navy.</p>

<p>All armies have now copied the Prussian General
Staff system, with modifications, but it is an error
to suppose that the General Staff duties were not
performed before the Prussians so styled them.
We have seen that they were carried out by the
Q.M.G. Staff. In the small armies commanded by
Frederick and Wellington, and by Napoleon at the
outset of his career, these great Generals were
virtually their own Chief of the General Staff.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span>
They wrote or dictated detailed orders, worked out
movements on the map, and perused states and
returns. Frederick himself gave orders for marching,
pitching camp, and fighting, sent them out by
his orderly officers, and watched their execution
personally.</p>

<p id="hdr_117">As Napoleon’s armies increased in size, the
General Staff duties became very heavy, and were
carried out most ably by Berthier, his “Major-Général,”
or Chief of the Staff. Their nature is
stated in quite modern shape by the great Swiss
Military writer Jomini, who had himself been Chief
of the Staff to Ney in 1805, as well as to the
Russian Army in 1813, after his desertion from the
French. (See “L’Art de la Guerre,” Vol. ii.,
chap, vi., par. 41.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
The Head-Quarters Staff in Napoleon’s great
wars was organized in the following manner:<a id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_B" href="#FNanchor_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> These particulars are taken from an article in the <cite>Times</cite> by the

<h4>UNITED STATES STAFF IN THE CIVIL WAR</h4>

<p>An example of organization of a Head-Quarters
Staff in a great war may be found in the Civil
War, in the United States. When General Grant
was Commander-in-Chief, his Staff consisted of
nineteen Officers:</p>

<h4 id="hdr_118">PRUSSIAN STAFF IN 1870</h4>

<p>It may be interesting to see how the Prussian
Head-Quarters Staff was organized for the strategical
conduct of the War of 1870.</p>

<p>At the head was Moltke, the “Chief of the
General Staff” in peace and war, who really
directed the operations, although nominally only
the adviser of the King of Prussia, the Supreme
Commander.</p>

<p>Moltke was assisted, and replaced when absent,
by the Q.M.G., who acted as Chief of the Office.</p>

<p>The General Staff under Moltke consisted of
twelve officers, and was organized in three Sections
as follows:</p>

<p class="in0 in4">
1. Operations.<br />
2. Railways and Communications.<br />
3. Intelligence.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span>
Each Section was under a Colonel, the “Chief
of the Section,” with one Field Officer and two
Captains as his assistants.</p>

<p>The Commissary-General of Supplies, and the
Director of Military Telegraphs were also attached
to the Staff.</p>

<p>Each <em>Army</em> had the following Staff, comprising
six to nine General Staff Officers:</p>

<p class="in0 in4">
One Chief of General Staff.<br />
One Chief Q.M.G.<br />
One to two Field Officers.<br />
Three to five other Officers.
</p>

<h3 id="hdr_119">2. <span class="smcap">The Supply and Transport Services</span></h3>

<p>The early forces in Europe subsisted merely by
individual plunder, each man obtaining his food
and forage as he could. Later, the central power
provided certain places where supplies were collected
by force. The next step in supplying armies
was taken when it was found that the local resources
could be drawn on to furnish supplies on
payment. This provided a more certain and
effective supply, and demanded fewer troops to
be employed in collecting. This change had a far-reaching
result. The fact that cash had to be
paid for these purchases caused Supply to come
under the Civil Finance Department. Hence we
find in Cromwell’s army this Service controlled by
the Treasury, as it continued to be down to the
Crimean War, with ill results for the army.</p>

<p>Transport was required to carry the supplies
from the districts whence they were collected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
to the area occupied by the troops, where they
were stored in magazines. The next step, therefore,
was to increase the mobility of the army by
providing additional Transport to move supplies
from these magazines up to the fighting troops.</p>

<p>The train which carried supplies was, during the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, a mass of
hired or pressed country carts and wagons, driven
by wagoners on foot, and difficult to manage or
move near the enemy. It was found that, unless
organized under military control, the transport
was not very efficient, and by the epoch of
Napoleon both the Transport and the Supply
Services had become more and more military in
organization. But they were both still <em>Civil
Services</em>, owing to the hold the Treasury had over
them, from the fact that both entailed constant
expenditure during war.</p>

<p>During the nineteenth century the <em>Train</em>
which provided transport became in all armies
a Military Organization, with enlisted drivers under
regular officers; while Supply continued to be
organized as a Department under Civil officials,
as it still is abroad. This system tends to produce
difficulties, as the Combatant Military Train
Officers have to move Supplies under the instructions
of the Civil Supply Officials, and in
foreign armies it is found difficult in war to make
both work in co-operation. The tendency is, in
fact, to bring about the close union between these
two Services, long since found desirable in England.
In all armies there are <em>Transport and
Supply Columns</em> formed from the Train with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
addition of Supply personnel. In England alone
are both provided from one Corps, the <em>Army
Service Corps</em>, and the description of the British
Transport and Supply Services given in <a href="#PART_II">Part II</a>.
illustrates what is perhaps the best organization
of these Services for war.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_120">3. <span class="smcap">The Medical Organization for War</span></h3>

<p>In the Middle Ages there was no medical
organization with armies, nor were there even
any surgeons. The sick and wounded were left
to shift for themselves, and were tended, if at all,
by private persons out of charity, or in monasteries,
for the monks alone possessed any knowledge of
surgery and medicine in those days.</p>

<p>Rudimentary provision for surgery in armies is
found in the organization of the German mercenaries
of the sixteenth century, where a surgeon
was appointed by each Captain for his Troop of
Reiters or Company of Landsknechts. Later, a
Surgeon was attached to the Regiment, and
medical care, from being purely a matter for the
Captain to organize, became a Regimental responsibility.
By this time the practice of surgery had
long passed from the hands of monks into those of
the barbers. Thus in the seventeenth century the
Prussians had <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Feldschere</i>, <em>Field Barbers</em>, attached
to Companies and Regiments for surgical duties.
There also began to be during the sixteenth
century a certain number of what we should call
<em>Staff Surgeons</em>, attached to the Higher Commands,
who were supposed to supervise the <em>Regimental
Surgeons</em>. The latter gradually became better<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>
educated, while the <em>Company Surgeons</em> under their
supervision remained merely rude subordinates.</p>

<p>During the seventeenth century the sick and
wounded were treated in tents pitched in the rear
of the camp as long as the army was stationary,
and tended by some of the women who accompanied
it. When it moved, they were handed over
to local authorities, or left in the villages near
the fighting. An effort was then made in most
countries to establish hospitals in the chief towns
in the theatre of war, into which the wounded
could be collected for better tending. By the
eighteenth century Army Surgeons were allotted
to these hospitals, which seem first to have been
organized in France, where, however, they were
managed by contractors. The abuses of this
system led to the hospitals being placed under
the Intendants of the Army, a change which
effected little improvement, as the Intendants,
through ignorance and apathy, hampered the
action of the medical department, and delayed
any improvement in it. France was the first
country to organize any sort of mobile hospital,
the germ of our <em>field ambulance</em>. One ambulance
wagon was provided per 1,000 men, and in battle,
dressing stations were formed in rear, to which
wounded found their way, or were carried on
stretchers. Stationary hospitals were also established
in rear, and the modern system of evacuation
of wounded to the rear was rudely organized.
The same idea was started in Austria, and, in a
less developed form, in Germany.</p>

<p>During the eighteenth century we find an organization<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>
of Regimental Surgeons, with attendants
and stretcher bearers, and a provision of field
equipment carried in wagons. Thus units corresponding
to Field Ambulances were gradually organized
in the armies of France, Austria, and
Prussia. There were larger organizations of the
same nature at Head-Quarters of the Armies,
and of the Higher Commands when these were
introduced in France during the Napoleonic Wars.
These Field Ambulances had ambulance wagons,
and other wagons carrying the dispensary and
kitchen, and the necessary equipment, stores, and
supplies, and were manned by a Corps of Hospital
Orderlies and Stretcher Bearers. In rear of these
units were stationary hospitals under military
control. The Austrian organization was nearly
as good as in France, but that of Prussia and
other States lagged considerably behind them.
In fact the Prussian troops had no medical organization,
beyond the provision of regimental surgeons,
at Jena, nor at Eylau, nor even at Waterloo.</p>

<p>It was not till during the nineteenth century
that modern Medical Organization gradually
evolved into its present highly developed condition
in all civilized armies. This can be studied
in the description of the British Medical Service
(<a href="#CHAPTER_X">Chapter X.</a>), which is nearly identical with that
of Germany, and may be considered to represent
a high type of Medical Organization for War.</p>

<p>This work will now conclude with some remarks
on the nature of Military Command, the methods
by which it is exercised, and the psychological
characteristics of soldiers and their leaders. The
final chapter is devoted to the last subject, a
matter worth deeper consideration in connection
with Command than it has yet received. When
it is remembered that, as stated in the first chapter,
it is the main object of Organization to facilitate
Command, the reason for touching on these
subjects in this work will be obvious.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_121"><span class="smcap">Mode of exercising Command</span></h3>

<p>Supreme Command in war is either exercised
by the Sovereign or by a Commander-in-Chief
who acts as his deputy, or, in a Republic or Constitutional
State, as agent of the Government. In
either case, on him the authority of the State is
devolved as regards the operations of the war.</p>

<p>Governments have not always been wise in their
control of the Military Commander or in their
direction of operations. Glaring instances may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
be found in history, notably in the conduct of
war by the younger Pitt, by the Aulic Council
in Vienna, and by Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the correct principles on
which a Government should control its Commanders
in war are exemplified in the highest
degree in those of the elder Pitt, afterwards Lord
Chatham. To his wisdom and judgment in conducting
operations by sea and land over all the
world must be credited much of the brilliant
success of the Seven Years’ War.</p>

<p>He himself defined the object of the operations,
but left the method of attaining it to his Commanders,
to whom he allowed a large measure of
latitude and discretion. He never failed to make
use of every incentive which could spur them
to action and ensure success. He insisted on the
initiative being taken, and risks run, but he was
always as generous in case of failure as he was
appreciative of good work. He succeeded in
inspiring the Admiralty and the War Office with
his own spirit and energy, and seconded their
efforts with all the resources of the country. The
lesson which his practice may teach every Government
engaged in war is, that while the Statesmen
alone can direct all the Departments of State, and
combine Navy, Army, Diplomacy, and Finance
to the common end, those responsible for the
actual operations must be unfettered in their
decisions, and in their method of carrying them
out.</p>

<p><em>Command</em> has in the large armies of the present
day become rather a <em>Direction of Operations</em>, differing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
essentially in character and execution from
the actual <em>Command of the Troops</em>. Frederick,
Napoleon, and Wellington <em>commanded</em>; Moltke
and Oyama <em>directed</em> their armies; while it was
mainly the Prussian and Japanese Division Commanders
who <em>commanded</em> in the true sense in the
wars of 1866, 1870, and 1904. Thus we seldom
see Moltke and Oyama on the battlefield, where
Napoleon, Wellington, and Lee were always to
be found.</p>

<p>The Subordinate Commander, like the Commander-in-Chief
of old times, differs from the
Supreme Commander of to-day by the fact that
his action on his Command is personal and direct.
He is in close touch with his subordinate leaders,
knows the condition and spirit of his men, is
always among them in person to inspire and
control their movements. Troops take their tone
from their immediate Commander, and reflect
his vigour or hesitation, his confidence or caution.
An intuition of his mental attitude seems to pass
through all ranks of the Command. On the other
hand the Army Commanders, and still more the
Commander-in-Chief, are but nebulous figures to
the soldiers in a very large Army.</p>

<p>Military Command is exercised in three ways,
which differ in character and scope. The Supreme
and Army Commanders prescribe <em>Instructions</em> to
their Subordinate Commanders; the latter issue
<em>Orders</em>; Commanding Officers of Units give
<em>Words of Command</em>. The latter method needs
no comment. The former modes will now be
discussed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_122"><span class="smcap">Instructions</span></h3>

<p>The system of Command customary before the
French Revolution survived well into the nineteenth
century. By it there were issued to each
tactical unit of the Army, Orders containing minute,
and even pedantic, details for carrying out the plan
decided on by the Supreme Command. These
details were not only wearisome to peruse, and
unnecessary for experienced subordinates, but the
time spent in merely copying and distributing
them was so great, that it had a most prejudicial
effect on the rapidity of the movements of the
army. This system may be said to have greatly
contributed to the ill success of the Austrians in
their many wars against Napoleon, owing to the
slow and dilatory movements it entailed.</p>

<p>The dissemination of the French Armies of the
Revolution led to the plan systematized later by
Napoleon, of giving short and general Instructions,
prescribing to each Subordinate only his own part
in the dispositions, with, perhaps, some information
about the position of adjoining bodies of troops.
This system had a great effect on the success of
the French forces, but it only won its way very
gradually in other armies. It is that now universally
adopted; but the modern practice differs
in one respect from that of Napoleon, who seldom
indicated the general object of the movements, no
doubt in order to avoid the danger of its becoming
known by the enemy. The tendency is now to
look on the latter danger as less than the evil
of imperfect co-operation. If subordinates do not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>
know the general situation, the object of the
operations, and the position of the enemy, they
will not always be able to act in accordance with
the Commander’s purpose. The size and dispersion
of modern armies make the independence
of subordinates far greater than in the days of
Napoleon, and have led to the practice of giving
them general information about the situation, so
as to ensure their co-operation to the common end.</p>

<p><em>Instructions</em> (German <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Directiven</i>) have been
defined by the German General Staff as “Communications
to a subordinate Commander intended
less to convey definite Orders for his immediate
action than to indicate leading features for his
general guidance, which should facilitate his judgment
as to the subsequent decisions to be taken
independently.” <em>Instructions</em> therefore generally
describe the situation, the operations decided on,
and their object, but leave considerable latitude
in the method of carrying out the general plan.
The Subordinate Commanders are expected to act
on their own judgment in furthering the Commander’s
purpose, observing the spirit rather than
the letter of their Instructions. For, it should be
noticed, military obedience in the higher ranks
does not lie in literal conformity to Orders, but
rather in a true conception of their spirit. Such
obedience is quite compatible with the independence
and self-confidence indispensable in the
Subordinate Commander, who has to act on his
own judgment in carrying out Orders. He must
take on himself the responsibility of giving effect
to his Instructions by acting in conformity with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
the situation of the moment, which may be
very different from the situation as it was when
they were issued.</p>

<p>As regards the drafting of Instructions, it must
be noted that the man who can make the best
plans is not always the one to express them best.
Napoleon’s brilliant combinations were embodied in
Instructions which were often involved in their
sequence, and ill-balanced from the intrusion of
details among the broad outlines of the general
plan. They were also generally so terse that they
were not always clear to any intelligence inferior
to his own. Jomini speaks of their “laconisme
outré,” partly due to Napoleon’s temperament, and
partly a revolt against the minute verbiage of the
Military Orders of his generation. Hence the
importance of a good Chief of the Staff, who can
act for his General as Berthier did for Napoleon.
He need not be a genius nor even a great strategist,
but he must be able to translate into lucid Orders
plans which he could never have originated, or
perhaps even, like Berthier, never fully understand
or appreciate.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Orders</span></h4>

<p>Subordinate Commanders, although they act with
some independence on the Instructions they themselves
receive, do not leave the same latitude to
their own subordinates. They exercise Command
by the issue of precise <em>Orders</em> for executing the
idea in the manner they themselves have decided
on. These Orders will contain the substance of
the Instructions they have received, as far as it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>
may be desirable to pass on this information to
their own subordinates. The method proposed to
carry out the general plan will probably need
explaining and developing in detail in the Orders.
These will therefore prescribe the definite steps to
be taken, such as the time and direction of marches
and attacks, or the measures to be taken for
security. Orders should <em>not</em>, as Instructions often
<em>may</em>, provide for contingent possibilities. The
issuer of an Order is generally on the spot, and can
leave such contingencies to form the subject
of further Orders. But unless a Commander can
be present, and direct the operations himself,
he must leave much latitude to those who have
actually to lead the Troops. Without this, the
operations will not always be the most suitable
to the conditions of the moment, and the vigour
which is the mainspring of successful action will
suffer.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Division Commanders</span></h4>

<p>During the war with France in 1870 the leading
on the part of the Supreme and Army Commanders
left much to be desired, but the way
in which the German Subordinate Commanders
worked together was very striking, and might well
be imitated in other armies. Their co-operation was
loyal, unhesitating, complete, and characterized by
initiative and resolution. Holding similar views
on fighting, and animated by the same energy, the
German Commanders acted together to one common
end—namely, to beat the enemy.</p>

<p>Subordinate Commanders require to possess<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span>
moral courage and readiness to take responsibility,
rather than merely physical bravery, while decision
and resolution are essential. There will be a solid
foundation of confidence and moral force in an
army whose Divisional Commanders are so endowed.
All Commanders should be brought up
in the same school, and hold similar views on the
conduct of war. This is the basis of good Command,
and ensures harmonious co-operation.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_123"><span class="smcap">Limits of Initiative in Staff Officers</span></h3>

<p>There is an essential distinction between the
action of <em>Commanders</em> and that of <em>Staff Officers</em>
however capable. It is true that Staff Officers are
not mere clerks or messengers. There is often
imposed on them the duty of explaining to the
immediate executive agents the intention of their
Chief, so as to solve ambiguities or remedy
misunderstandings, and to create identical views on
the situation, especially if it be rapidly changing.
But it is outside the scope of the Staff to interfere
with the exercise of Command—that is, on their
own authority, to urge, or approve, or condemn
any particular action on the part of Subordinate
Commanders. To do so is to usurp the function of
their Chief, and to form a lateral interference with
the direct chain of responsibility. Such action
commonly leads to a struggle of conflicting temperaments,
contrary to all discipline, and tends to
produce anarchy in the Command.</p>

<p>Only one man can command. It is true that
the nominal Commander has not always been this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>
one man, owing to some physical, intellectual, or
moral deficiency in his character. In that case his
action is necessarily guided by a substitute, who
will really inspire the operations, but whose influence
should always be concealed. Even in this
case, however, it is essential that the Chief must
rely on <em>one</em> man only. Should he turn for advice
and guidance to more than one, his action will
soon follow divided courses, owing to alternate
predominance of contradictory counsels. Counter-orders
will unfailingly ensue, with the inevitable
result, neatly summed up by the French as “ordre,
contre-ordre, désordre.” In War, it is not true that
“in a multitude of counsellors there is wisdom.”
We know that “Councils of War never fight,” and
that the greatest Commanders have always regarded
them as a detestable and cowardly subterfuge.
Success can never be expected when, instead of the
decision of one, the counsels of many prevail.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<span class="subhead">PSYCHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF ARMIES</span></h2>
</div>

<p id="hdr_124">An Army in action is a special instance of what
may be termed a <dfn>dynamic crowd</dfn>—that is, an assemblage
of men united for common action and
inspired by the same ideas and desires. Throughout
history, certain characteristics have been exhibited
by assemblages so united, however differently they
were composed, and no matter under what conditions,
or towards what ends, they were acting.
Popular assemblies in epochs of change, spiritual
ebullitions such as have marked the origin, or revival,
of religions, political parties, and even juries, boards,
and committees, all show similar phenomena. But
the most striking instances of dynamic crowds are
mobs collected for action. Such mobs have usually
worked harm, when they must be called criminal
mobs, but have often been violent with good intentions,
as when the Paris mob took the Bastille.
Other instances of non-criminal mobs actuated by
high enthusiasm are those roused for the First
Crusade by Peter the Hermit, or that incited by
Mark Antony, at the funeral of Cæsar, to avenge
his murder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
Of nature akin to crowds are unions of persons
holding similar opinions, even when not actually in
touch with each other, or physically assembled.
Such unions have produced, and will yet produce,
some of the greatest changes in history, like the rise
of Christianity, the Renaissance, the Reformation,
and the French Revolution. In all ages, systems
of religious thought have created such dynamic
aggregates, often world-wide and endowed with
persistent vitality. The most striking examples
are the unions of nations and races which form
the Mohammedan world, or the Roman Catholic
Church.</p>

<p>But a combination of armed men for the purpose
of fighting has always been the commonest and
strongest form of organized assemblage. Such a
combination is the highest example of a dynamic
crowd, and has effected the most rapid and striking
changes which the world has undergone.</p>

<p>The essential underlying character of a “dynamic
crowd” of any sort is that it possesses <em>religion</em> in
the sense defined by a great French psychologist,
as “placing all the resources of the spirit, all the
submission of the will, all the ardour of fanaticism,
at the service of a Cause, which then becomes the
guide and end of all the ideas and actions of the
assemblage.”</p>

<p>A crowd may be looked upon as a sort of new
composite personality born of the union of a
number of men whose individual qualities will
not by any means represent the character of the
crowd they form. The crowd may be said to have
a collective soul which will cause it to act in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>
way in which the individuals composing it would
not, and indeed could not, act. This soul is
generally inferior to the average character of the
persons forming the crowd, but at times rises
to heights impossible to them. Thus crowds have
often committed atrocities from which their component
individuals would have shrunk, but other
crowds have shown incredible enthusiasm and
devotion, and performed acts of heroism and self-sacrifice,
to which no individual in them could
ever have risen singly. Examples of the crimes
of crowds are patent in history, but their heroisms
also may be found, most of all in the innumerable
instances when troops have faced death without
flinching, and thereby gained victory for their
Cause.</p>

<p id="hdr_125">The characteristics of crowds may be glanced at.
They will be seen to be analogous to those which
animate troops. Crowds act on instinct and are
incapable of reasoning, so that they are essentially
irresponsible, while very easily influenced by suggestion.
Their impressions are extraordinarily
infectious, for Man is an imitative animal, and
still more so is Man in bulk. Hence, suggestions
spread like fire, and impressions and tendencies
to action are communicated with the greatest
rapidity, for, in a crowd, reason has little influence
on the action, and self-concern, so potent in the
individual, is effaced in the confidence born from a
sense of the power of numbers. So we may note
among soldiers at one time the spread of panic,
and at another the not less infectious courage due
to combination. Both are capable of producing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
striking action for harm or for good, and action
quite impossible for the individual when alone.</p>

<p id="hdr_126">All crowds, even those of animals, have an
overwhelming craving to be led. A leader is
needed to strike the spark to kindle the mass,
give shape to its idea, and instigate its action. A
crowd loves to adopt a leader to be its despot, and
will be obedient and even servile to him who
shows he can command. The leader influences the
crowd by three means—<em>assertion</em>, <em>repetition</em>, and
<em>example</em>. All these means are necessary to implant
ideas in an unreasoning mass, and initiate
unanimous action towards their realization. The
<dfn>assertion</dfn> must be concise and simple, and should
epitomize the ideas which form the “religion” of
the crowd. <dfn>Repetition</dfn> is necessary to drive these
ideas home. Reasoning is out of place, and has
the worst effect, for crowds cannot reflect, and are
as impatient of appeals to their reason as of
opposition to their desires. The <dfn>example</dfn> of the
leader exercises a potent influence. A crowd is
easily impressed by his coolness, courage, self-confidence,
determination, and vigour in utterance
and action, and even by his personal appearance.</p>

<p>Leaders are generally men who are themselves
carried away by the ideas they are striving to put
in effect, although some have been calculating, cool,
and astute. They are generally men of action,
and action impresses when reason is unavailing.
One quality leaders must have, and that is Will
Power. A mere crowd has none, for the will of
the individual becomes effaced when once he is
united with his fellows, and the will of the leader<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
must replace it, flashing out from his voice and
his bearing, and felt in his words and his deeds.
But the crowd will also react strongly on the
leader, and may inspire him to a pitch far above
his natural scope, but only on condition that the
leader has among his qualities and his aims some
that are germane to the “religion” of his followers,
for the “Soul of the Crowd” to work on.</p>

<p id="hdr_127">What has been said of crowds and mobs applies
in the main to the organized and trained mob
which has become an army. A mass of soldiers
differs from a mob mainly in the habits acquired
by discipline, the facilities for action afforded by
organization, and the ideal of character which their
profession, and their very uniform, suggest to them
to live up to. The discipline of the soldier, if it
is to be worth anything in a crisis, must be so
habitual as to be not reasoned, but instinctive.
Under the strain of war, whether due to danger or
to privation, habits can be relied on when reason
fails. Discipline is not only the instinct of
obedience, but that of reliance on leaders and
comrades, both factors of enormous value in battle.
It is this which gives troops the advantage over a
mob. Psychologically they are both “dynamic
crowds,” but the mob is devoid of the higher
qualities which discipline has implanted in the
soldier, and which the influences of his profession
have rendered largely instinctive.</p>

<p id="hdr_128">It should be noticed that in crowds, where the
individual varieties of character are lost in the
“crowd soul,” the oldest racial characteristics come
out. This is the more so in the moments when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span>
danger inhibits reason, and instinct alone reigns.
History teaches us very clearly how persistent these
characteristics are in the people as a whole, and
they are naturally brought out in a high degree
by War. Cæsar tells us that the Gauls “are very
courageous and impetuous in the attack,” and
two thousand years later the “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Furia Francese</i>” is
still their characteristic. A French writer on the
wars in Spain talks of the “<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Bulldog Ténacité</i>” of
the British, a quality which has been attributed
to them for centuries.</p>

<p>The reason for this is clear if we suppose that
the crowd possesses the sum of the qualities of its
members, for the different individual qualities of
each will bulk but little compared to the huge
total of the qualities common to all, of which
the older and deep-rooted race characteristics will
necessarily form a large part.</p>

<p>Thus history shows unmistakably that the
military qualities of a nation change but little
with time. The conduct of its soldiers in past
wars is likely, therefore, to be repeated in future
fighting, although organization, training, and leading
may differ, and, to some extent, modify the
result.</p>

<p id="hdr_129">In the case of an Army, the necessity of Will
Power in the leader cannot be too much emphasized.
It is of far more importance than mere
intellect. Will power alone can go far, as we
see in the cases of Charles XII. and Blücher,
whereas resolution is apt to be “sicklied o’er with
the pale cast of thought,” where the intellect is
more developed than the will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
Some Military Leaders have been energetic and
resolute, but wanting in continuity of effort, and
little capable of thought and reflection. Of this
type were Ney and Murat, amazing in the conflict,
heroic in danger, but, in less inspiring
moments, failures. These men need a greater
man to lead them. Such a man, in whom Will
Power and Intellect are both dominant and are
equally balanced, constitutes the higher and rarer
type of leader. In him the Will Power is more
lasting, if less fiery; he can reflect, assume
responsibility in cold blood, and carry out long
plans in spite of opposition. The rule of such
leaders over their followers is not liable to sudden
collapse, but often outlives failure or ruin. Of
such are those who have changed the face of the
world and won undying fame—Alexander, Hannibal,
Cæsar, Cromwell, Napoleon—men whose
prestige is not buried in their grave, but still
exercises over living men an influence hardly
less real than during their life.</p>

<p>This prestige, unexplainable as it may be, constitutes
the dominating influence of the leader over
his following. Built on success and renown, it is
made up of admiration, love, and sometimes fear,
but is always unreasoned and idolatrous. It is
by the domination of prestige that a leader is able
to impress his feelings, his aims, and his will on
those he leads. The exertions to which Hannibal
and Napoleon could compel their men were incredible.
A leader is at times obeyed by his
followers as the lion-tamer by his lions, although
often with as little means of coercing them, or even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>
of saving himself from their jaws. Nor is the effect
of prestige limited to the leader’s own following;
it is as much felt by his opponents. Napoleon’s
arrival on a battlefield was, Wellington said,
worth a reinforcement of forty thousand men, and
many of his successes in war were due to the fact
that his enemies were frightened by his name,
before they began to fight. Probably only two of
his opponents escaped this influence—Blücher, in
whom hatred left no place for fear; and Wellington,
who said before the Peninsular War that he
thought he could beat the French because he was
not afraid of them.</p>

<p>The prestige of Hannibal, like that of Nelson,
always weakened the resolution of his foes. Dundonald
with one ship chased a Portuguese squadron
from Brazil to Europe. Drake’s very name was an
abiding terror to Spain. “Stonewall” Jackson’s
reputation was a constant alarm to Lincoln and
the Federals. Lee’s personality was one of the
main factors in staving off defeat from the South.</p>

<p>When the crisis of her fate arrives, a country
can only pray that a <em>Leader</em> may be granted
her. History can teach us that England has
seldom prayed in vain. Cromwell, Marlborough,
Clive, Wellington, the men of the Mutiny, and,
above all, the long line of Admirals which culminates
in Nelson, were living answers to her
prayers.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_130">APPENDIX A<br />

<span class="subhead">ORIGIN OF MILITARY TERMS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>This chapter is intended to give an explanation of the way
in which military terms—especially those connected with
Organization—came to have their present technical meaning.
Their derivation and, in some cases, the date of their introduction
are given. Many of these terms have been noticed
in the body of the text, and their origin mentioned. They
are here collected for facility of reference.</p>

<p>It will be noted that most of our commonest military terms
are of considerable antiquity, and that they are essentially
cosmopolitan words, widespread in use through Western
Europe. Most of them were introduced in Italy during the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.</p>

<p>The terms are arranged alphabetically in four lists:</p>

<p>1. Ranks and Offices.</p>

<p>2. Names of the different varieties of Troops, and of their
Units and Formations.</p>

<p>3. Arms and Accoutrements.</p>

<span class="subhead">REMARKS ON MILITARY NOMENCLATURE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In any Science the first step towards systematizing it is
to form a definite terminology on systematic lines. Nor is
this mere pedantry. Words are the expressions of thought;
without defined terms there can be no clear thinking.</p>

<p>None can have read much, or written at all, on military
matters without noticing the unsatisfactory nature of many
of the terms used. Few are short, crisp, and definite, like
<em>Troop</em>, <em>Squad</em>, <em>Staff</em>. Compare these with <em>Regiment</em>, <em>Division</em>,
<em>Artillery</em>. Confusion also constantly arises from the indeterminate
meanings of words like <em>Commander</em>, <em>Section</em>,
<em>Brigade</em>, <em>Unit</em>.</p>

<p>Other words are cumbrous, like <em>Medical Services</em> (or <em>Officer</em>),
<em>Mounted Infantry</em>, <em>Ammunition Column</em>, <em>Lines of Communication</em>,
<em>Mounted Brigade</em>, <em>Veterinary Services</em> (or <em>Officer</em>).
Some single words are urgently needed instead of these.</p>

<p>In British Establishments, simplification would result if
there were one word for <em>Drummers</em>, <em>Buglers</em>, and <em>Trumpeters</em>,
and one for all personnel except Officers. <em>Dismounted men</em> is a
poor name for men who were never mounted.</p>

<p>The organization of Artillery cries out for some systematized
terms. <em>Field Artillery</em> includes in foreign armies the
batteries of Field Guns, Howitzers, and Horse Artillery, but is
generally used for those of Field Guns only. A general word
to include guns and howitzers is needed. <em>Wagon</em> is used for
transport wagons and ammunition wagons, and a single word
for the latter is much needed; the American word <em>caisson</em>,
or the old English <em>tumbril</em>, might be used. A better word is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
wanted for <em>Machine-Gun</em>, which is not a gun, but a rifle.
<em>Divisional Artillery</em>, a unit of several Brigades under a
General, might have a special name. <em>Divisional Ammunition
Column</em> seems a very long term when writing Orders.</p>

<p><em>Cavalry</em> and <em>Infantry</em> might well be usually replaced
by <em>Horse</em> and <em>Foot</em>. The words <em>Troop</em> and <em>Squadron</em> might
be used without the addition of “Cavalry,” as indeed <em>Company</em>
and <em>Battalion</em> without adding “Infantry.” It would be
convenient if, in the British Service at any rate, the word
<em>Regiment</em> always connoted Horse, to avoid adding “Cavalry,”
just as Battalion connotes Foot.</p>

<p>Turning to ranks of Officers, the word <em>General</em> might be
used instead of <em>G.O.C.</em> The term <em>Commander</em> is used
indiscriminately, and might be confined to Subordinate
Commanders of Corps and Divisions, leaving <em>Commander-in-Chief</em>
for the Army Command, with <em>Supreme Commander</em>
where there are several Armies. A single word for the
<em>Divisional Commander</em> would be convenient, like <em>Brigadier</em> for
the Brigade Commander. <em>Commanding Officer</em> should always
imply the C.O. of a Cavalry Regiment, Infantry Battalion, or
Artillery Brigade, and might be rendered, as in French, by
the word <em>Chief</em>. The word <em>Captain</em> does not imply the important
and similar functions of the Squadron, Company,
and Battery <em>Leader</em>, who is often a Major; and the word
<em>Leader</em> might be adopted. The good old words “Cornet”
and “Ensign” might be reintroduced.</p>

<p><em>D.A.A.G.</em> and <em>D.A.Q.M.G.</em> are deplorable titles, as are
also <em>Inspector-General of Communications</em> and <em>Commander of
Lines of Communication Defences</em>.</p>

<p>We have <em>Gunner</em>, <em>Driver</em>, and <em>Sapper</em>; why should not
<em>Trooper</em> be officially used for private of Cavalry?</p>

<p>It would be convenient if the word <em>Train</em> were officially
used for all the non-fighting Trains.</p>

<p>Now that the whole force of a great nation includes
several Armies, it is desirable to have a separate word for
the whole <em>Army</em>. Perhaps <em>Host</em>?</p>

<p>A short word (like <em>Base</em>) is much needed for the <em>L. of C.</em>
and the <em>Advanced Base</em>. Perhaps <em>Rear-Routes</em> and <em>Fore-Base</em>
might be used?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
A better word for <em>Advanced Guard</em> would be <em>Foreguard</em>, on
the analogy of Rear-Guard and Vanguard. The cumbrous
expression “Commander of the Advanced Guard” might
then be replaced by <em>Foreguard Chief</em>.</p>

<p>The awkward French word <em>depôt</em> (with its accent) might
be replaced by the Old English word <em>stow</em>, which we find
surviving in place-names, where it meant a military depôt
during the English conquest of Britain.</p>

<p>The importance of shortening and defining military terms
does not rest only on the convenience of writers and readers.
The advantage in saving time, and conducing to lucidity,
cannot be overestimated when Orders are to be written and
read, often under difficulties and in a hurry.</p>

<p>A scientific system of Military Terminology would thus
prove of real value in war. The above observations are
made in order to call attention to this matter, in the hope
that official action may one day lead to a more logical system
of military terms.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
